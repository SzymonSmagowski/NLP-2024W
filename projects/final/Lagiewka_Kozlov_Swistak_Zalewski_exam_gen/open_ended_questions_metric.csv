0;What is the primary difference between syntactic analysis and semantic analysis in the context of natural language processing?;Syntactic Analysis: Syntactic analysis, often referred to as parsing, is the process of dissecting a sentence or text into its grammatical components. It deals with the arrangement of words, phrases, and clauses to determine the sentence structure. This step is essential for understanding the relationships between words in a sentence and forms the foundation for subsequent semantic analysis. Semantic Analysis: Semantic analysis delves into the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. It is concerned with deciphering the intent and significance of the language used. Unlike syntactic analysis, which focuses on the structure, semantic analysis looks at the content and context, aiming to uncover the underlying meaning conveyed by the text. This step is critical for extracting insights, answering questions, and making sense of language in NLP applications.;The primary difference is that syntactic analysis focuses on the structure of sentences, while semantic analysis focuses on the meaning and context of the language.;126;18;0.5;16;0.8888888888888888;2.6666666666666665;0.013071895424836602;41;1;126.0;-113.75499999999997;60.42777777777778;371.36000000000007;What is the primary difference between syntactic analysis and semantic analysis in the context of natural language processing?

5;What are some of the challenges in evaluating the accuracy of Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems, and how do precision, recall, and F1 score address these challenges?;"Formal evaluation
To evaluate the quality of an NER system's output, several measures have been defined. The usual measures are called precision, recall, and F1 score. However, several issues remain in just how to calculate those values. These statistical measures work reasonably well for the obvious cases of finding or missing a real entity exactly; and for finding a non-entity. However, NER can fail in many other ways, many of which are arguably ""partially correct"", and should not be counted as complete success or failures. For example, identifying a real entity, but: 
with fewer tokens than desired (for example, missing the last token of ""John Smith, M.D."")
with more tokens than desired (for example, including the first word of ""The University of MD"")
partitioning adjacent entities differently (for example, treating ""Smith, Jones Robinson"" as 2 vs. 3 entities)
assigning it a completely wrong type (for example, calling a personal name an organization)
assigning it a related but inexact type (for example, ""substance"" vs. ""drug"", or ""school"" vs. ""organization"")
correctly identifying an entity, when what the user wanted was a smaller- or larger-scope entity (for example, identifying ""James Madison"" as a personal name, when it's part of ""James Madison University""). Some NER systems impose the restriction that entities may never overlap or nest, which means that in some cases one must make arbitrary or task-specific choices.
One overly simple method of measuring accuracy is merely to count what fraction of all tokens in the text were correctly or incorrectly identified as part of entity references (or as being entities of the correct type). This suffers from at least two problems: first, the vast majority of tokens in real-world text are not part of entity names, so the baseline accuracy (always predict ""not an entity"") is extravagantly high, typically >90%; and second, mispredicting the full span of an entity name is not properly penalized (finding only a person's first name when his last name follows might be scored as ½ accuracy).
In academic conferences such as CoNLL, a variant of the F1 score has been defined as follows:[9]
Precision is the number of predicted entity name spans that line up exactly with spans in the gold standard evaluation data. I.e. when [Person Hans] [Person Blick] is predicted but [Person Hans Blick] was required, precision for the predicted name is zero. Precision is then averaged over all predicted entity names.
Recall is similarly the number of names in the gold standard that appear at exactly the same location in the predictions.
F1 score is the harmonic mean of these two.
It follows from the above definition that any prediction that misses a single token, includes a spurious token, or has the wrong class, is a hard error and does not contribute positively to either precision or recall. Thus, this measure may be said to be pessimistic: it can be the case that many ""errors"" are close to correct, and might be adequate for a given purpose. For example, one system might always omit titles such as ""Ms."" or ""Ph.D."", but be compared to a system or ground-truth data that expects titles to be included. In that case, every such name is treated as an error. Because of such issues, it is important actually to examine the kinds of errors, and decide how important they are given one's goals and requirements.
Evaluation models based on a token-by-token matching have been proposed.[14] Such models may be given partial credit for overlapping matches (such as using the Intersection over Union criterion). They allow a finer grained evaluation and comparison of extraction systems.

";Challenges in evaluating NER systems include handling partially correct identifications, such as missing or including extra tokens, misclassifying entity types, and dealing with overlapping or nested entities. Precision, recall, and F1 score address these by measuring exact matches: precision counts correct predictions, recall measures correct identifications in the gold standard, and F1 score balances the two.

6;What are some methods used to evaluate the quality of language models?;A language model is a probabilistic model of a natural language. Evaluation of the quality of language models is mostly done by comparison to human created sample benchmarks created from typical language-oriented tasks. Other, less established, quality tests examine the intrinsic character of a language model or compare two such models. Since language models are typically intended to be dynamic and to learn from data they see, some proposed models investigate the rate of learning, e.g., through inspection of learning curves.;Some methods used to evaluate the quality of language models include comparison to human-created sample benchmarks from typical language-oriented tasks, examining the intrinsic character of the model, comparing two models, and investigating the rate of learning through learning curves.;70;12;0.5;12;1.0;2.4494897427831783;0.0;24;1;70.0;-33.414999999999964;35.31;288.41;What are some methods used to evaluate the quality of language models?

7;What is the significance of using n-grams in Natural Language Processing (NLP) compared to traditional bag-of-words models?;"An n-gram is a sequence of n adjacent symbols in particular order.[1] The symbols may be n adjacent letters (including punctuation marks and blanks), syllables, or rarely whole words found in a language dataset; or adjacent phonemes extracted from a speech-recording dataset, or adjacent base pairs extracted from a genome. They are collected from a text corpus or speech corpus. If Latin numerical prefixes are used, then n-gram of size 1 is called a ""unigram"", size 2 a ""bigram"" (or, less commonly, a ""digram"") etc. If, instead of the Latin ones, the English cardinal numbers are furtherly used, then they are called ""four-gram"", ""five-gram"", etc. Similarly, using Greek numerical prefixes such as ""monomer"", ""dimer"", ""trimer"", ""tetramer"", ""pentamer"", etc., or English cardinal numbers, ""one-mer"", ""two-mer"", ""three-mer"", etc. are used in computational biology, for polymers or oligomers of a known size, called k-mers.

8;What are the different ways to categorize AI hallucinations, and how do they differ based on their relationship to the source or prompt?;"In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), a hallucination or artificial hallucination (also called bullshitting,[1][2] confabulation[3] or delusion[4]) is a response generated by AI that contains false or misleading information presented as fact.[5][6][7] This term draws a loose analogy with human psychology, where hallucination typically involves false percepts. However, there is a key difference: AI hallucination is associated with erroneous responses rather than perceptual experiences.[7]

For example, a chatbot powered by large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, may embed plausible-sounding random falsehoods within its generated content. Researchers have recognized this issue, and by 2023, analysts estimated that chatbots hallucinate as much as 27% of the time,[8] with factual errors present in 46% of generated texts.[9] Detecting and mitigating these hallucinations pose significant challenges for practical deployment and reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios.[10][8][9] Some researchers believe the specific term ""AI hallucination"" unreasonably anthropomorphizes computers.[3] In natural language processing, a hallucination is often defined as ""generated content that appears factual but is ungrounded"".[24] There are different ways to categorize hallucinations. Depending on whether the output contradicts the source or cannot be verified from the source, they are divided into intrinsic and extrinsic, respectively.[7] Depending on whether the output contradicts the prompt or not they could be divided into closed-domain and open-domain respectively.[25]";AI hallucinations can be categorized as intrinsic or extrinsic based on their relationship to the source.

12;What are some of the applications and advantages of transformer architectures in deep learning, and how do they differ from earlier recurrent neural architectures like LSTMs?;"A transformer is a deep learning architecture that was developed by researchers at Google and is based on the multi-head attention mechanism, which was proposed in the 2017 paper ""Attention Is All You Need"".[1] Text is converted to numerical representations called tokens, and each token is converted into a vector via lookup from a word embedding table.[1] At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism, allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished.

Transformers have the advantage of having no recurrent units, therefore requiring less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM).[2] Later variations have been widely adopted for training large language models (LLM) on large (language) datasets, such as the Wikipedia corpus and Common Crawl.[3]

Transformers were first developed as an improvement over previous architectures for machine translation,[4][5] but have found many applications since. They are used in large-scale natural language processing, computer vision (vision transformers), reinforcement learning,[6][7] audio,[8] multimodal learning, robotics,[9] and even playing chess.[10] It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs)[11] and BERT[12] (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers).";Transformers are used in applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning, audio processing, multimodal learning, robotics, and playing chess.

13;What is the purpose of using word embeddings in natural language processing, and how are they typically represented?;In natural language processing, a word embedding is a representation of a word. The embedding is used in text analysis. Typically, the representation is a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word in such a way that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning.[1] Word embeddings can be obtained using language modeling and feature learning techniques, where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.;The purpose of using word embeddings in natural language processing is to represent words in a way that captures their meanings and relationships, allowing similar words to be closer in the vector space.

14;What are the two main categories of approaches for producing multi-sense embeddings, and how do Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (MSSG) and Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA) differ in their methods for handling word sense representation?;"Historically, one of the main limitations of static word embeddings or word vector space models is that words with multiple meanings are conflated into a single representation (a single vector in the semantic space). In other words, polysemy and homonymy are not handled properly. For example, in the sentence ""The club I tried yesterday was great!"", it is not clear if the term club is related to the word sense of a club sandwich, clubhouse, golf club, or any other sense that club might have. The necessity to accommodate multiple meanings per word in different vectors (multi-sense embeddings) is the motivation for several contributions in NLP to split single-sense embeddings into multi-sense ones.[32][33]

Most approaches that produce multi-sense embeddings can be divided into two main categories for their word sense representation, i.e., unsupervised and knowledge-based.[34] Based on word2vec skip-gram, Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (MSSG)[35] performs word-sense discrimination and embedding simultaneously, improving its training time, while assuming a specific number of senses for each word. In the Non-Parametric Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (NP-MSSG) this number can vary depending on each word. Combining the prior knowledge of lexical databases (e.g., WordNet, ConceptNet, BabelNet), word embeddings and word sense disambiguation, Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA)[36] labels word-senses through an unsupervised and knowledge-based approach, considering a word's context in a pre-defined sliding window. Once the words are disambiguated, they can be used in a standard word embeddings technique, so multi-sense embeddings are produced.

The model is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words.

16;Who developed the word2vec algorithm and in what year was it published?;"Word2vec is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) for obtaining vector representations of words. These vectors capture information about the meaning of the word based on the surrounding words. The word2vec algorithm estimates these representations by modeling text in a large corpus. Once trained, such a model can detect synonymous words or suggest additional words for a partial sentence. Word2vec was developed by Tomáš Mikolov and colleagues at Google and published in 2013.

Word2vec represents a word as a high-dimension vector of numbers which capture relationships between words. In particular, words which appear in similar contexts are mapped to vectors which are nearby as measured by cosine similarity. This indicates the level of semantic similarity between the words, so for example the vectors for walk and ran are nearby, as are those for ""but"" and ""however"", and ""Berlin"" and ""Germany"".";Word2vec was developed by Tomáš Mikolov and colleagues at Google and published in 2013.;71;12;0.5833333333333334;12;1.0;2.4494897427831783;0.0;20;1;71.0;-6.22999999999999;31.76666666666667;292.83500000000004;Who developed the word2vec algorithm and in what year was it published?

17;"How does ELMo's architecture utilize forward and backward LSTMs to resolve the polysemy of the word ""bank"" in the sentence ""She went to the bank to withdraw money""?";"ELMo (embeddings from language model) is a word embedding method for representing a sequence of words as a corresponding sequence of vectors. The architecture of ELMo accomplishes a contextual understanding of tokens. For example, the first forward LSTM of ELMo would process each input token in the context of all previous tokens, and the first backward LSTM would process each token in the context of all subsequent tokens. The second forward LSTM would then incorporate those to further contextualize each token.

Deep contextualized word representation is useful for many natural language processing tasks, such as coreference resolution and polysemy resolution. For example, consider the sentence

She went to the bank to withdraw money.
In order to represent the token ""bank"", the model must resolve its polysemy in context.

The first forward LSTM would process ""bank"" in the context of ""She went to the"", which would allow it to represent the word to be a location that the subject is going towards.
The first backward LSTM would process ""bank"" in the context of ""to withdraw money"", which would allow it to disambiguate the word as referring to a financial institution.
The second forward LSTM can then process ""bank"" using the representation vector provided by the first backward LSTM, thus allowing it to represent it to be a financial institution that the subject is going towards.
";"ELMo's architecture uses the first forward LSTM to process ""bank"" in the context of ""She went to the"", suggesting it's a location.

Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) is a language model introduced in October 2018 by researchers at Google.[1][2] It learns to represent text as a sequence of vectors using self-supervised learning. It uses the encoder-only transformer architecture. It is notable for its dramatic improvement over previous state-of-the-art models, and as an early example of a large language model. As of 2020, BERT is a ubiquitous baseline in natural language processing (NLP) experiments.[3]";BERT is significant in natural language processing for its dramatic improvement over previous models and as an early example of a large language model.

19;What is the primary goal of information extraction (IE) as described in the chapter, and how is relation extraction related to this process?;"This chapter presents techniques for extracting limited kinds of semantic con- tent from text. This process of information extraction (IE) turns the unstructured information embedded in texts into structured data, for example for populating a relational database to enable further processing.
We begin with the task of relation extraction: finding and classifying semantic relations among entities mentioned in a text, like child-of (X is the child-of Y), or part-whole or geospatial relations. Relation extraction has close links to populat- ing a relational database, and knowledge graphs, datasets of structured relational knowledge, are a useful way for search engines to present information to users.";The primary goal of information extraction (IE) is to convert unstructured information from texts into structured data.

21;How do transformers use attention to build contextualized representations of word meanings across different layers?;"The point of all these examples is that these contextual words that help us com- pute the meaning of words in context can be quite far away in the sentence or para- graph. Transformers can build contextual representations of word meaning, contex- tual embeddings, by integrating the meaning of these helpful contextual words. In a transformer, layer by layer, we build up richer and richer contextualized representa- tions of the meanings of input tokens. At each layer, we compute the representation of a token i by combining information about i from the previous layer with infor- mation about the neighboring tokens to produce a contextualized representation for each word at each position.
Attention is the mechanism in the transformer that weighs and combines the representations from appropriate other tokens in the context from layer k − 1 to build the representation for tokens in layer k.";Transformers use attention to weigh and combine representations from relevant tokens in the context from the previous layer to build contextualized representations for tokens in the current layer.
