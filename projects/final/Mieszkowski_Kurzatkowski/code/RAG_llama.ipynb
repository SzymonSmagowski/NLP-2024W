In an interview with the RBK news agency, Peskov said that Russia \"theoretically\" does not need to hold presidential elections because \"it's obvious that Putin will be reelected.\"\n",

Schools in Kursk were ordered to shift to remote learning for the rest of the week, while a missile alert was declared in the city. On 12 March, the Russian military operational headquarters of Kursk Oblast banned the publication and distribution of content showing Russian military personnel, artillery strikes, air defenses, and drone strikes in an effort to preserve operations security in the region.\n",
      "On 14 March, the ISW noted an increase in anti-government discontent in the military's handling of the incursions, similar to the discontent expressed by the ultra-nationalist opposition, such as Igor Girkin and Yevgeny Prigozhin, during the 2023 Belgorod Oblast raids. However, these critiques are far less likely to proliferate through the general Russian public, as the Russian government has taken a concerted effort to take control of the Telegram info-space to censor anti-government opinions following the Wagner Group rebellion. However, the ISW concluded that the Russian government must soon make a decision to either reallocate military resources to Kursk and Belgorod, or pay a \"reputation cost\" among the ultra-nationalists.\n",
