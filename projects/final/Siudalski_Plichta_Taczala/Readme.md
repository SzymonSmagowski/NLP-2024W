# International Agreements Data Base mining

This project realized in cooperation with faculty members from the University of Lodz aims to explore the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze a vast collection of international agreements from U.S. states and municipalities.

The primary goal of the analysis is to address the following challenges:
- Identification of areas of cooperation mentioned in the agreements.
- Identification of the parties involved (states,
institutions, local partners).
- Identification of the types of agreements
(e.g., Memorandum of Understanding, Sister
Cities Agreement, etc.).
- Determination of the percentage of agreements under the patronage of Sister Cities International.
- Identification of international organizations
mentioned in the agreements.
- Determination of the terms of validity for
each agreement.
- Identification of the length of each agreement
(number of pages or words).
- Determination of the conditions for extending each agreement (automatic/ by decision).
- Analysis of the frequency of recurring
clauses in the agreements (always, often,
rarely) â€“ the level of detail in the agreements.
- Identification of the partners with whom the
agreements tend to be more detailed.
- Indication of whether the agreement includes
an evaluation of its implementation.
- Identification of whether the agreement mentions any coordination of activities with other
entities (e.g., government, other cities/states,
international organizations).
- Identification of whether the agreement refers
to other legal documents.
