            "I. Collaboration on Addressing Carbon Dwellings\n",
            "\n",
            "1. The Parties shall collaborate to design, implement, and report on large-scale benchmarking and disclosure of energy performance data on existing and newly constructed large-scale carbon dwellings, aiming for at least 75% of large eligible building square footage on the Pacific Coast to report energy performance data through state, provincial, or local programs harmonized across the region.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Rationale: Benchmarking and disclosure of energy performance data in large carbon dwellings create a crucial foundation for long-term GHG reduction efforts. The Pacific Coast has pioneered flagship benchmarking and disclosure programs that serve as models for the region. Through collaboration, the Parties can expand these programs throughout the region, align state and provincial policy with local implementation, and leverage shared tools and resources.\n",

The Parties shall collaborate to develop and implement approaches that encourage adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) through incentives, consumer education, and increased availability. The Parties shall also collaborate with manufacturers to increase the variety and volume of commercially available EVs in the Pacific Coast region.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Rationale: The early stage of ZEV market development requires consumer incentives to drive market development. State ZEV programs and the Pacific Coast Collaborative's ZEV Action Plan have proven effective in increasing the availability and variety of vehicles. Regional collaboration among the Pacific Coast Jurisdictions and Cities can accelerate the ZEV market, encourage consumer demand, and leverage incentives to deliver EVs to local markets.\n",

            "\n",
            "2. Rationale: The Pacific Coast is a leader in the deployment of community-scale renewable energy. The regional collaboration among the Parties can seize opportunities for reducing GHG emissions through local adoption of distributed and community-scale energy while addressing systemwide issues of grid infrastructure, cost, reliability, and regulatory barriers.\n",
            "\n",
            "IV. Low Carbon Waste\n",
            "\n",
            "1. The Parties shall collaborate to advance organic waste prevention and recovery initiatives, including source separation and composting, to reduce carbon emissions from the food waste stream and return carbon to the soil.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Rationale: Waste prevention and recycling initiatives present significant opportunities to reduce GHG emissions. Collaborative efforts can support the sharing of best practices, scaling of successful local initiatives, and development of diverse infrastructure for recycling organic materials.\n",

The MOC has the following key components:\n",

The MOC can be terminated by either CARB or the Municipality. In case of termination, the Municipality will make reasonable efforts to return the sensors to CARB. The MOC may be amended at any time with the authorization of both parties.\n",

            "9. **Sensor Installation and Operation**: The Municipality will install and operate the sensors in Mexicali, using the designated locations, with a focus on providing effective particulate matter (PM) monitoring. The sensors will be used as a tool to identify sources of high PM concentration in the area and to support actions to enforce regulations limiting activities that adversely impact air quality. The Municipality will quarterly report the actions taken to reduce PM emissions based on sensor data.\n",
