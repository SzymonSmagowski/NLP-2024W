In the book "Konrad_Wallenrod", the author uses the word "wiach" which is a Polish term for "vih" or "veil" in English. In this context, it seems like the author may have used the word "wiach" as a typo or a non-standard spelling of "veil". The correct English translation of this fragment would be something like "In the book 'Konrad Wallenrod', the author uses the word 'veil' which is a Polish term for 'vih' or 'veil' in English."

Here's the translated fragment in English:

As the years passed, the love between the two grew stronger. But fate was not kind. One day, when they were walking in the forest, a sudden thunderstorm arose, and they took shelter in a cave. Inside the cave, they found a treasure trove. The sudden wealth made them forget about their love and each started to indulge in worldly pleasures.

Eventually, they both died of starvation, as they had forgotten to take out food from the cave. Their souls are now united in the afterlife, but their love has been forgotten.

Introduction

In the year 1828, the author of this book, Adam Mickiewicz, a student of the University of Vilnius, was imprisoned for participating in a secret society. During his imprisonment, he learned of the history of the Teutonic Knights and their role in the history of Lithuania. This inspired him to write a story about a Lithuanian hero who infiltrated the Teutonic Order and destroyed it from the inside. The book was published anonymously in Berlin in 1828, and quickly became a symbol of resistance against Russian rule in Poland and Lithuania. The story is told in the first person, and the hero is named Konrad Wallenrod, after a Teutonic knight who lived in the 14th century. The book is a blend of historical facts and fictional elements, and has been widely studied

Here's the translated fragment from "Konrad Wallenrod" into English:

"During the course of the war, a number of knights from the Teutonic Order, who were dissatisfied with the leadership of their Grand Master, decided to seize power. On the day of the feast, they marched towards the tent of the Grand Master, intending to overthrow him. However, the knights who supported the Grand Master, led by Count Keldorff, put up a strong resistance and forced the mutineers to flee. Many of them were captured and sentenced to death. Among the condemned was a young Litwin named Walter, who had joined the Teutonic Order as a spy. His true name was Konrad Wallenrod."

The textbooks of history tell us that the Teutonic Knights, the Order of the German House of Saint John, and the Order of the Holy Sepulchre were warlike brotherhoods. They were founded in the twelfth century, and their main purpose was to protect pilgrimage routes in the Holy Land. The Teutonic Knights were particularly active in the Baltic region, where they were involved in a long-term conflict with the State of Livonia. The Order of the Holy Sepulchre, on the other hand, was founded in the twelfth century and its main focus was on the protection of Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land. The German House of Saint John, also known as the Order of Saint John, was founded in the twelfth century and its main purpose was to protect pilgrimage routes in the Holy Land.
