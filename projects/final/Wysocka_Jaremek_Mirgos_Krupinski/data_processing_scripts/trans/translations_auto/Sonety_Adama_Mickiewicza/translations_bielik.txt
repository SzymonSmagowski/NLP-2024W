Ascend \( Czufut-Kale. \) A town on a lofty rock; the houses on the edge standing have the appearance of jester's nests; the path leading to the top is unpleasant and hanging over a chasm. In the town itself, the walls of the houses almost join the rock itself; looking through the window, the eye gets lost in the inFinite depth.

Here is the English translation of the given fragment:

"In the first of these verses, the speaker describes the beauty of the landscape, with its snow-capped mountains and tranquil lakes. He compares the scene to a dream, and wonders if it is possible for such a place to exist in reality. The second verse introduces the idea of unrequited love, which the speaker says is a difficult subject to write about. He admits that he is unable to express the depth of his emotions, and feels overwhelmed by the pain and sadness that come with this type of love. The third verse continues this theme, describing the anguish that comes with unrequited love. The speaker says that it is as if his heart has been struck by a dagger, and that he feels a constant sense of longing and yearning for something he cannot have. Despite the pain and suffering, the speaker knows that he will continue to love

XIV.


Translation:

XIV.

In this sonnet, Mickiewicz expresses his thoughts about the fleeting nature of beauty and love. He acknowledges that beauty and love are temporary, and that they will eventually fade away. However, he also believes that the memories of beauty and love can remain with us forever. In the first four lines, he describes the beauty of a summer's day, and how it fades as the seasons change. He then reflects on how love between two people can be like a summer's day, and how it too can fade away over time.

But, in lines 5-8, Mickiewicz takes a turn and expresses a more hopeful view. He writes about how the beauty of nature can be preserved in art, and how that art can bring joy to people for generations to come. He also mentions that the beauty of nature can be seen in the eyes

Translation:

In the following sonnets, Mickiewicz presents a vision of a dream-like world, where the supernatural and the natural coexist harmoniously. The beauty of nature is contrasted with the suffering and turmoil experienced by the protagonist, who is torn between the desire for a peaceful existence and the need to engage in the struggle for freedom and independence. The sonnets convey a sense of longing for a better world, one in which the individual can attain harmony and fulfillment through both the spiritual and the earthly pursuits.

In the step of the deserts, I saw
A young wild man, who was about to bide
His heart with the heart of a wild ass.
His mind was obstrued, and his soul
Filled with dust, and his body was as bare
As the mummies of the deserts lay.

His eyes were like two black stars,
His hair like a snake; his beard like a serpent;
And his voice like a wild ass's bray.

He came from the step of the deserts,
Where the black turtle lies in the sand;
And his heart was like the heart of the step.

In the step of the deserts, I saw
A young wild man, who was about to bide
His heart with the heart of a wild ass.

"Sonnets by Adam Mickiewicz

In nature, who can read the mind of the bird?
In the heart of the wild, where does the wolf
Go for his pleasures? where does the bear
Go to find his food? where does the eagle
Set his gniazdo, and where does the swan
Carry his chick?"
