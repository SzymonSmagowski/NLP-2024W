— Sir — interjected the president's wife.
===
— What can I merit for the grace of the lady? — he said, taking her hand. — Certainly not pity... Nor is that the kind of feeling one would like to receive, nor is it the kind one would like to give. Pity is a feeling that is as unpleasant to the one who is pitied as it is to the one who pitches. Pity is not what I want... But must I not consider this, that, as long as you live in Warsaw, I tell myself: I shall see you, tomorrow... next... Well, I can always see if not you, then at least my father, Mikołaj, or the house itself...
===
— O! panna Katarzyna to smaczny kąsek — mówiła gospodyni. — Oko ładne (choć zdaje mi się, że ma skazę na lewem czy na prawem?).... figurka niczego, chociaż musi mieć jednę łopatkę wyższą (ale to dodaje wdzięku). Nosek wprawdzie nie w moim guście, a usta trochę za duże, ale cóżto za dobra dziewczyna!... Gdyby tak trochę więcej rozumu... No, ale rozum, panie Wokulski, przychodzi kobietom dopiero około trzydziestego roku... Ja sama, kiedy byłam w wieku Kasi, był

Wokulski smiled.


Tłumaczenie: Wokulski się uśmiechnął.
===
Two gentlemen entered the salon, both very elegantly dressed. One of them had a slender neck and quite noticeable bald spot, while the other had glassy-eyed looks and a sophisticated way of speaking. They both entered side by side, with their caps at the same height, bowed and sat in unison. Afterward, Mr. Rydzewski worked to keep his neck upright, while Mr. Pieczarkowski spoke without pause.
===
Now, Miss Izabela felt very embarrassed.
===
They said goodbye. Mr. Tomasz pressed Wokulski's shoulder more affectionately.
===
— Does it fit you? — asked boldly Mr. Maleski.
===
— It doesn't matter what I'm after, but I heard that Stach is selling his store to the Jews... Well, and I won't take a job in their service anymore.
===
— Let us sit, Mr. Wokulski — said the prince. — It is fortunately that we happen to have a matter to discuss with you. Imagine, Mr. Wokulski, that your business plans have caused a great stir among our bawełnianych manufacturers... Indeed, I may say that they fear you are going to kill our industry... Is that correct, the mention of a genuine business?... They claim that your competition, which you create, is terribly dangerous. Do you believe that their concerns are justified?...
===
"So does this young man have principles?" exclaimed Miss Izabela. "That's interesting!"
===
The fragment translates into English as:

— That's what you see: the pretty lady stole the other lady's doll...
===
Mrs. Wąsowska exploded with anger.
===
Wokulski grabbed her hand.
===
— Even if it's not a wife! — replied with a smile the baronowa von Ples, whose husband had been paralyzed for five years.
===
"Run to the castle, because maybe Mr. Wokulski is still having fun there, so don't let any tragedy happen to him." And I also immediately flew there.
===
"And both of his equally bored friends," said Miss Izabela with a smile. "Everyone loved me and declared their love to me at certain hours, so as not to disturb others, and later all three confided in each other with their suffering. These gentlemen do everything together, including declaring their love to me."
===
- Yes.
===
The following is the English translation of the given text:

While the old man was talking with great fire about how his late husband was an excellent district president, I didn't listen too much about what Mrs. Stawska was discussing with Mr. Wokulski. It must have been interesting, as they were talking softly.
===
"Nie" - odpowiedział Wokulski, rzucając się na plecione krzesło przed ladą. Ponieważ wstydził się od razu wyjaśnić, po co przyszedł, więc zapytał:
===
Wokulski dobrze znał ludzi i często porównywał się z nimi. Lecz gdziekolwiek był, wszędzie widział się trochę lepszym od innych. Czy jako subjekt, który spędzał noce nad książką, czy jako student, który przez nędzę szedł do wiedzy, czy jako żołnierz pod deszczem kul, — zawsze miał w duszy ideę, sięgającą poza kilka lat naprzód. Inni żyli z dnia na dzień, dla swego żołądka, albo kieszeni.


Tłumaczenie: Wokulski knew people and often compared himself with them. However, wherever he was, he always felt a little better
===
— Ach, ta!... wiem... Nie mnie się podobała — westchnął Rzecki — tylko myślałem, że dobra byłaby z niej żona dla Stacha...

Translation: 

— Oh, that one!... I know... I thought she'd be a good wife for Mr. Wokulski...
===
— You've also beaten the bastards! I know, I know — whispered into my ear. — Sit down — added, indicating a chair. — Kaziek! Hurry to Grandmother... Mr. Rzecki has arrived...
===
— Does Mr. Molinari have been at home? — asked the butler.

Tłumaczenie:

— Does Mr. Molinari be at home? — inquired the butler.
===
- "Tere-fere!" - says Szprot and gestures with his finger in the air. It's easy for you to demand satisfaction, because you're a Hungarian officer. To kill a man - or even two - is to kill a man for you is bread with butter... But I'm a trade agent, I have a wife, children, and term interests.
===
"My triumph was short - said she to herself. – Krzeszowski really does shoot well... If he kills the only man who stands up for me today, then what? The duel is an istotally barbarous relic. Because Wokulski (taking him from the moral side) is worth more than Krzeszowski, and yet... maybe he will have to die!... The last man my father trusted in."
===
Embarrassed, Mr. Ignacy went down to the ground floor of the front vestibule, holding the album under his arm and bowing to all the ladies around him. This politeness, which Warsaw people did not usually practice, already made an impression. People began to ask: who is that? Although they did not recognize the person, they quickly noticed that Mr. Ignacy's cylinder was from ten years ago, his tie from five, and his dark-green suit and tight trousers with check pattern dated back even further in time. Everyone assumed him to be a foreigner; but when he asked a servant which way to sit? a laugh erupted.
===
She was troubled by other questions: should she return the china to Countess Karolowa - and - where did her father get the money? If he had had it before, why has he allowed the debts to be taken out by Mikołaj?... And if he did not have it then, where does he get it today?... If she does return the china and silver to her aunt, may she lose the opportunity to get rid of them in a profitable way, and if she sells them for five thousand, these memoirables may indeed get into the wrong hands, as the Countess had warned in her letter.
===
A gdyby jednak dowiedzieć się, kim ona jest? ... Może potrafiłbym jej pomóc. Dlaczego wzniosłe obietnice Chrystusa nie mają być spełnione, choćby przez takich jak ja niedowiarków, skoro wierzący zajmują się czem innem?

Tłumaczenie: And if I could find out who she is? ... Maybe I could help her. Why don't the lofty promises of Christ be fulfilled, even though such people as me, doubters, are doing something else? While the faithful are doing something else, I wonder if I could help her.
===
"Yes! — whispered — with these gentlemen it is more pleasant to live than with merchants. They are really made of a different clay."
===
After getting over the first dislike, Miss Isabelle understood that marriage must be accepted as it is. She was already decided to get married, provided that the future husband — would please her, had a beautiful name and an appropriate fortune. Fortunately, or unfortunately, there were people who please fit her criteria; unfortunately, however, none of them combined all three conditions, so — again, several years passed.
===
Wokulski closed the book, slowly stood up from the chair and, reaching for his hat on the ledge, moved towards the door. He felt a shortness of breath and seemed to have a sensation of swelling in his skull.
===
— I prefer to answer rather than take walks with them. When we last went for a ride with Miss Wąsowska, in the course of two hours, I got off the horse six times, and didn't have five minutes of peace. Let the Mr. Wokulski try.
===
My second observation related to Maruszewicz, who lived almost next door to Mrs. Stawska. This man has a very peculiar lifestyle, characterized by remarkable regularity. Regularly, he does not pay his rent. Regularly, every few weeks, he is evicted from his apartment: statues, mirrors, carpets, clocks... But what more interesting, he is regularly evicted from his apartment and replaced with new statues, new carpets, new clocks...
===
"When Wokulski entered the doctor's room and exhausted sat down on the couch, the doctor started:"
===
"Well, cóż — thought — whoever came, must go... A matter of course...“
===
Each of these people, for a certain time, occupied secret thoughts of Miss Isabela, dedicated to each the most silent westchnings, knowing that she could not love him for these or other reasons, and each, for the sake of the deity, appeared to her in his semireal dreams. And the eyes of Miss Isabelle took on a new expression, of a supernatural contemplation. Sometimes they looked at people and beyond the world; and when her pale hair on her forehead arranged itself in such a strange way, as if a mysterious gust blew over it, when looking at them it seemed to the observers that they were seeing an angel or a saint.
===
The man takes the newspaper out of his pocket, puts it in his pocket, finishes his mazagran and pays for it. The caddie looks sideways, the two guests sitting next to him raise their legs even higher, and one of them looks at the caddie impertinently through his monocle.
===
Suddenly — a carriage passes him with a loud sound on the top, carrying two women. One is completely unknown to him, the other...
===
— Miss Wąsowska doesn't allow it, because you'll overturn it! — exclaimed Miss Felicya, who was destined for Mr. Wokulski.

— Cousin of the Krzeszowskis... — thought. — Will get a love letter from Miss Isabelle... And a scoundrel!...
===
Once he said something without any reason.
===
— So, that weighs half a kilogram... But it's empty... — replied Wokulski.
===
— Where does he go? Where does he live?...
===
P. Ignacy dużo mocniej założył binokle i podniósł się na swoim fotelu, jakby chciał jednym ruchem obalić nową teorię, która sprzeciwiała się jego przekonaniom; ale wejście drugiego subiekta, z brodą, poplątało mu szyki.
===
While Starski was arguing with the widow, and panna Felicya was blushing, Wokulski watched his fiancée. He noticed this, glared at her, and suddenly, from inexpressible sadness, she came to childlike mirth. She willingly gave her hand to the baron for a new kiss, and even unconsciously kicked him. Her admirer was so affected that he pale and his lips turned blue.

In November, exactly on the same day the house on Wspólna Street collapsed, Wokulski returned from Moscow. And I can't even begin to imagine what he did there, but I swear that the business he was a shareholder in must have been honest! The profits he made are beyond my comprehension, but I swear they were honest!
===
— Poor boy! — said, laughing... — He got two thousand rubles a year and ten thousand paid off. I advise him to marry for money, but he prefers to go to Vienna, and probably to Monte Carlo... I said he should go with us. It will be more fun, won't it?

Miss Izabela wiped her eyes and quickly left the ruins. Behind her went Mr. Wokulski.
===
— I judge that we can move on to the question of local factories. Now, Mr. Wokulski, please explain to us, with the usual joading, the positive benefits that arise from your project.
===
As he approached closer, Wokulski noticed that not only had he drawn attention to the particular building, but even dogs, more frequently here than on any other wall, were laying their business card.
===
— What? Do you think that I am praising you to get some francs?... Tomorrow I will visit you again and will show you, as this moment, you are injustice and foolish...
===
— Maybe I'll come right away... — said Wokulski, looking down.

— Mr. Stanisław — began the advocate. — Do you know what our aristocracy and its accessories are? It is a few thousand people who suck the whole country, waste money abroad, bring the worst habits home, infect the middle classes, allegedly healthy and—absolutely doomed: economically, physiologically, and morally. — If we force them to work, if we cross them with other layers, maybe... there could be some benefit, because they are more delicate organizisms than ours.

— Why must it happen?... — exploded Rzecki. — Is it a bankrut who couldn't find work...? Or is it just a business, a partnership that's nothing? What's a store, a partnership like this? And why didn't he marry a beautiful, honest woman?

The above-mentioned excerpt in Polish can be translated into English as follows:

Across from us, maybe a mile away, there were two hills, and between them a road. I noticed that the road's yellow background showed some white shapes, which soon formed a white line and a white patch. At the same time, from a parchment ditch lying a few hundred yards to our left, soldiers appeared, who quickly organized themselves into a column of dark granite. At this moment, to our right, a cannonball roared and almost immediately over the Austrian battalion rose a gray cloud of smoke. Three or four minutes of silence and then another cannonball roar, followed by another gray cloud of smoke...

===
She didn't respond anything, but in her heart, she was making bitter reproaches to herself that she cannot love Wokulski, though she might want to. Her heart is dry; moreover, she herself is not certain if she has a heart... She thought about Wokulski while in the store, and at home; she waited for his visits, and when he did not come, she was irritated and sad. She often dreamed him, but it was not love; she is not capable of love. If she had to say the truth, she even no longer loves her husband. It seemed to her that the memory of the absent is like a tree in autumn, from which the leaves are falling with whole tornadoes, and only the black skeleton remains.
===
The above sentence in English is:

— Quick return...
===
"He had a right, didn't he?" said the count.

Meanwhile, the train traveled slowly, stopping for long on each station. The air cooled, and the stars on the east began to fade. Wokulski closed the window and reclined on the swaying canapa.
===
— Sucha woman! — said the doctor, waving his hand. — Instead of gardening the motlo, which she has abandoned several times, she is intoxicated by their company. Everyone can see, and what's worst of all is that Wokulski sees it too...

Well, but what to do if they are just waiting for money?... Maybe there will be enough?...

From the foot of the hill, to the edge of the horizon, there was a vast plain, and on it, like a white smoke cloud, a wide stream that seemed to flow for several hundred yards, or who knows, maybe a mile long.

Wokulskiemu znowu zdawało się, że z oczu spada mu zasłona, poza którą widać zupełnie inny świat i inną pannę Izabelę... Ale w tej samej chwili uczuł taki zamęt w głowie, ból w piersiach, szał w nerwach, że uciekł do przedpokoju i ztamtąd na ulicę, obawiając się, że traci rozum.

Translated: Wokulski felt as if a veil was being removed from his eyes, behind which there was an entirely different world and a different Miss Isabelle...

Wokulski listened attentively to Pruszków. Beyond Pruszków, the monotonous and unvarying voice of Mr. Tomasz began to bother him.
