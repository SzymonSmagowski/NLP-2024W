From the east, the wind blew, and with it came a sickly, sweet smell, like the one that is received in the nose after a great cut or wound. And through the darkness and the gloom, there came a sound like the lowing of a herd of beasts, and the deep, baseless groan of the earth and the trees, as if they were saying: 'O come, O come, ye all who would see the great

If you are brave enough to come at me, I will eat you

A wave obscured the world; within a few steps there was nothing to see. The Cossacks abandoned the siege, fled one after the other towards the camp, ran blindly, met with each other, and seemingly fleeing before an enemy in pursuit, dispersed and,toppling, went in aim of the tabor. In their wake, the artillery, ammunition, and wagons were porched; the water pouring in the trenches and ditching rowls, roared after the pursued Cossacks, as if trying to overtake the fleeing mosquitoes.
