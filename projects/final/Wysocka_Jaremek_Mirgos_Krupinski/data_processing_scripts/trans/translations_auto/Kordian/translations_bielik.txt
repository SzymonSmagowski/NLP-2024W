TABLE OF CONTENTS

In the final act of this tragedy, Kordian's fate is determined by three symbolic characters who represent the three powers that control the destiny of the protagonist.

CEZAR

The first character, the Roman Emperor, is a tyrant who rules by terror and is consumed by his own power and vanity. He is not interested in the suffering of his subjects and is concerned only with maintaining his power and status.

In a monologue, the Emperor describes the state of his soul, which is filled with fear and pride, as he watches the preparations for a public execution. He is aware of the evil that he does, but he is unable to change his ways. He is also aware of the fact that his power is temporary and that he will eventually be overthrown.

The Emperor is a symbol of the political and social forces that control the fate of the individual and
===
"Do not take back what you have given; I have already become accustomed to it."
===
The storm won't disperse
===
Where does the emperor sleep... is he curious,
===
"But wealth in love is a fleeting and insignificant dream,"
===
Translation:

Garden. – The lip avenues intersect in various directions – among the trees, you can see a deserted house with smashed windows... Autumn – the leaves are falling – windy – KORDIAN and LAURA dismount, and enter the avenue... They don't say anything to each other for a long time.

CHORUS

 Translation:

CHORUS

(In a solemn, inspiring tone)

Description of the scene: a forest at night, with the moon shining brightly. A group of travelers makes their way through the forest, and they stop to rest by a lake. The travelers are approached by a mysterious, ghostly figure.

Notes for the reader: This scene is a symbolic representation of the human condition and the struggle for freedom and enlightenment. The mysterious figure is a representation of the unknown and the unseen forces that shape our lives. The travelers are a symbol of the Polish people, struggling against the oppression of the foreign rulers and seeking to establish their own independence. The moon shining brightly in the night sky represents the hope for a brighter future, as well as the idea that there is a divine plan for humanity.

SZATAN

Kordian, a man of weak heart,
Sits alone, lost in thought,
Wondering if he has any purpose in life.
He feels a darkness in his soul,
A void that he cannot fill,
And his life seems to lack meaning.
He looks to the sky, wondering if there is a higher power,
A god that he can worship,
To find solace in his despair.
But as he sits,
His thoughts turn to the future,
And he imagines all the things he could have done,
All the places he could have been,
All the people he could have loved.
He feels a sense of regret,
A longing for a life lived to the fullest,
A life filled with passion and purpose.
He wonders if he has missed something,
If there is a hidden meaning to his existence,
A reason why he was born
===
The payment is a silent, dark grave;

KORDIAN

*Sits on a rock; before him the vast expanse of a bubbling volcano; behind him the snowy peaks of Mont Blanc.*

*Tells the story of his life and love for Laura, who he believes has married another.*

*Feels despair and loses the will to live. Then his Angel appears and inspires him to seek a purpose in life.*

*Kordian, feeling inspired, decides to fight for the freedom of his country and the people of Europe. He will go to Russia to conquer the tyrant Tsarist, and if successful, he will become a great leader for his people.*

*The Angel disappears, leaving Kordian alone with his thoughts and determination to change the world for the better.*

Fragment z książki Juliusza Słowackiego "Kordian":

PIERWSZY Z LUDU

*wskazuje na Kordiana i mówi do siebie*

O, młody pan! słyszysz, panie,
Jak wicher dmie i szumi w lesie?
To młodego ducha postacie
Wybiegają z więzienia w lesie.

*zwraca się do Kordiana*

A ty, młodzianie, czy słyszysz?
Jak płacze kwiat więziony w lochu,
Kiedy go słońce jasne grzeje,
A on myśli, że już nie zochce.
