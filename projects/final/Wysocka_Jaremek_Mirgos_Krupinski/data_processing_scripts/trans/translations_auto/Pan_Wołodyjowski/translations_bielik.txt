Ketling took Zagłoba in his arms, who became really moved and immediately ordered a bottle to be brought, saying:

Both natarli on each other in the middle of the field. Mr. Muszalski wanted to show off his great strength and catch Hamdi alive, so after delivering a powerful blow to turn the man over, he entangled himself with him, catching him by the throat and the misiurka by the hair, and pulled him towards himself with great force. At that moment, the leather strap on his terlicka broke, so the unparalleled archer turned over with the terlicka, falling to the ground. Hamdi, who was falling alongside him, hit him in the head with the handle of his bułat and knocked him out cold. Zked were the spahis and mamelukes who had already been afraid of Hamdi; the Poles were very worried about the archer, then the wrestlers rushed towards each other in large crowds, one group to capture Hamdi and the other to at least protect

Buty made of thin leather, lined with fur, which were perfect for sanis or horseback riding, did not protect her feet sufficiently from hitting rocks and nails, and in addition, were quickly dry due to the warmth of her feet, now raised by fever, which could easily wear out in the forest.

And she jumped up on the hill. They waited and watched, full of fear and worry. Nobody was sleeping in the house. The thought that Ketling might already be a corpse filled their hearts. In addition, the night became dark, dusky, with thunder rumbling and rolling across the sky. Then, early in the morning, the first storm of the year broke out. The servants woke up.

And she began to twirl on the cart, repeating with tears:

— And clean conscience, and clean conscience! — answered Zagłoba. — Your wise man says: „Ten się drapie, kogo swędzi,“ and I have nothing to scratch at, so I am happy! O! to hell with ten thousand devils! what have I got to see? Have I ever seen you speak in Polish, in a fur-trimmed cap, and with a sword, and now you have transformed myself into some Englishman and walk about on thin legs, like a heron?

— But not that fancy! Oh, how to behold it, it is a pity that he must be seen rather than a prince from such a noble blood. If it were not for these times, I would say that he is more like a servant than a prince. Yet, for the sake of our fatherland, it is necessary to put aside any personal considerations. Skrzetuski will also tell you the same thing. Whatever the hetman does, I will do as well, because I believe in the sincerity of him for the good of our country.

And in half an hour, Wołodyjowski emerged in the field at the head of dragons and landowners, who numbered, in all, about two thousand. They hoped to have a good show in the harce. From the old castle, a perfect view was of the cavalry, numbering about two thousand, composed partly of Spahis and partly of the Eyalet of Egypt's guard, consisting of the mighty Mamlukes from the nilotic provinces. The shining armor of these, the gold-embroidered keffis on their heads, and the white burnuses and the brightly-bedecked swords made them the most magnificent cavalry in the world. Armed with spears, with curved swords, and with knives that hung from bends in their siodles, they flew over the field like a rainbow, yelling and twisting the włócz

One horseman served us as a pillow, we ate from one dish; Kastor and Pollux they called us. And only when he went after the Miss Borzobohata to Żmudź, the time of separation came; who would have thought that his best hopes would pass away as swiftly as an arrow on the air?

Epilogue

In the end, the Sobieskis took Basia to their home in the city, and the little group that had followed their horse-drawn carriages was spread in the court-yard of the house. The old was a good old man, and the young, Janek, loved her very much.
===
Having said that, she looked around for the rogues, but they were fleeing in a group. There was no possibility of a single fight, but Basia wanted to lay proof that she was not just fleeing blindly and wildly.
===
"Explain to me what this brotherhood is," said Basia.
===
Considering all this, the older officers were very worried and happy outcome less likely to them. As it was not only due to the Turkish forces but also to them themselves, it was a very unlikely outcome. Mr. Wołodyjowski was an unbeatable and famous soldier, but he did not have the majesty of greatness. Who has the sun in him, can immediately warm everyone around, while who is a flame, can only warm the nearest. It was the same with the little knight. He could not transfer his spirit into others, as he could not master the art of swordsmanship. Mr. Potocki, the chief commander, was not a fighter, and he lacked confidence in himself, in others, and in the Commonwealth. The bishop had the most on his mind, counting on diplomatic negotiations; his brother had a heavy hand, but also a heavy mind. The relief was impossible, because Pan Sobieski

In the next chapter, Pan Michał got into a fight with a dragon, and the dragon's rider, who was a knight of the Teutonic Order, recognized him as the famous "Hussar" from the stories he had heard. The knight, who was from the city of Gdańsk, was on a mission to avenge the death of his brother, who had been killed by the Hussar in a previous battle. The two adversaries engaged in a fierce battle, but Pan Michał managed to defeat the knight and save the day.

The enemy must have noticed the approaching court cuirassier regiment, because in the same moment a host of horsemen sprang out of the thicket in the middle of the plain, as if someone had disturbed a herd of deer. They were coming at a trot, crouching on their horses' necks, so from a distance one might mistake them for a flock advancing in a long line along the edge of the thicket. Visibly they had not yet gained certainty as to whether this unit was pursuing them and had seen them, or whether it was only scanning the neighborhood. In the latter case they might hope that the thicket would hide them from the approaching units still unknown to them.

But he held her so tightly as if he wanted to strangles her... A short breath came out of his lips, his eyes mgled, and finally he pulled her out of the stirrups, removed her kirk, and threw her in front of him, pressing her breasts to his own and making his sine teeth search for her lips.

Meanwhile, the cry was getting louder and louder. There was a fire in the cathedral, which took over the Armenian goods, built on the marketplace, belonging to this nationality. There were great wealth in gold, silver, carpets, skin, and expensive materials there. Soon, here and there, you could see language of fire over the houses.

Here's the translated fragment in English:

At this, four sides of the forest begin to converge quickly, merge into four walls and form the Chreptiow witch. Basia is there and sees everything clearly. There is a large fire burning on the stove, and on the benches, officers are sitting as usual; Pan Zagloba is arguing with Pan Snitko; Pan Motowidlo is sitting quiet and looking into the flame, and when something hisses in the flame, he says his deep voice: "Soul of the ghost, what do you need?“ Pan Muszalski and Pan Hromyka are playing dice with Michal. Basia comes up to them and says: „Michal, I'll sit on the bench and a bit embrace you, because it's strange to meIX. “ Michal immediately embraces her: „What's wrong, kitty? Or maybe...

Pan Wołodyjowski nie sprzeciwił się temu, bo go Zagłoba do zgody skłonił. Wiedział bowiem, że kiedyś i tak trzeba będzie chęci Basinej zadośćuczynić, wolał więc zaraz, zwłaszcza że grasanci łuków i samopałów nie mieli zwyczaju używać.

There will be a siege, my sweetest doe, there is no escape from it, but we will not yield, because each defends not only his homeland but also his own private property.

It may also be that she was already experiencing a slight dizziness. Wołodyjowski was surrounded by the reputation of the first soldier of the Republic. All knightly lips were repeating with honor his name. His reputation was covering him with admiration; there was a charm around him, and in addition, the maiden, living with him under one roof, had become used to his beauty.

Captain Zagłoba was so well-known that his name could not remain hidden for long. Besides, he did not hide it. As a result, the prince became even more angry but also somewhat worried, hearing that the person he intended to kidnap was a man so well-known that it was fearful to try to kidnap him.

In this renewed battle, from the old Chreptiow risers, only two were killed: pan Motowidło and the fierce archer, pan Muszalski. Pan Motowidło was pierced by several bullets at once, and he fell like an oak that has reached the end of its life. Eyewitnesses said that he died at the hands of those Cossacks under Hohol who, until the end, fought against their mother and against Christ. Pan Muszalski, for his part, was killed by a bullet fired by some Turkish man who, in flight, had directed it at him. His neck was pierced by the bullet, at the very moment when, in the aftermath of the total defeat of the pagans, he reached for his saber to fire more pursuers of death.
