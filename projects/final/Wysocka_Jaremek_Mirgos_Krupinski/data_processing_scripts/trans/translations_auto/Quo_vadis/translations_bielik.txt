The translation of the given fragment from "Quo_vadis" in English is:

— Take me with you...
===
— By the power of Christ! — began to say quickly. — I'll stay here, and she'll take my tesseract, wrap her head in a cloth, cover her shoulders with a cloak, and leave. There are a few young henchmen in the graveyard, so the pretorians won't recognize her, and once she gets into Petronius' house, he'll save her!
===
— Let the old cap shut up, panie, or grant me the right to smash his head with my fist. Once in Buxentum, where Luciusz Saturninus sent me for the games, seven drunken gladiators attacked me in a tavern, and none came out unscathed. I'm not saying that we should kidnap a girl from between the crowd now, as they might throw stones at us, but once she's in your house, I'll take her and carry her wherever you want.
===
Having gained some courage, he asked:
===
"Whatever they do," he said to himself, "for me they will do, even though none of them guess it. Gods, gods, let me just...
===
— Go to Cypr with us. However, remember that you must see yourself with Caesar. It is evil that you have not been there yet; Tigellinus will exploit this against you. He does not have personal hatred of you, but he cannot love you simply because you are my nephew ... We will say that you were ill. Tell him that you did not go to see him because Lygia had become tiring to you. He will understand. Tell him also that your illness was worsened by your worry that you could not be in Naples to hear his singing. And to recover from the fever, you were aided only by the hope that you would hear him. Do not be afraid to exaggerate. Tigellinus promises that he will come up with something not only great but also idiotic for Caesar ... I am afraid, however, that he might undermine me. I am also afraid of your disposition ...
===
He embraced her and for some time held her in his arms, with such enthusiasm as if miraculously saved. Then, unplotting his arms, he took her head in his hands, kissed her forehead, eyes, and again embraced her, repeated her name, bowed to her, worshiped her, and honor. His joy had no limits, nor his love and happiness.
===
That man tried to stand, but in an instant the fatal ropes enveloped him, with each movement tying him tighter by his hands and feet. Meanwhile, the blows of the triomphean spear hit him again and again, knocking him down to the ground. He then tried once more to stand, supporting himself on one hand and stretching, but he could not keep balance and fell back down. Kalendio then bit down on his neck with the widelefs, press against the spear's shaft with both hands, and turned towards the emperor's box.
===
"Not only have I avoided danger for Aulus Plaucius and Pomponia, but I have also prevented them from searching for Lygia, who will not be looked for, even because I have convinced that miedzianobrody man to go to Antium, and then to Neapolis or Baiae. He has long desired to perform in all the theaters of Greece, and then to triumphally enter Rome with all the wreaths that the "Graeculi" are offering to him, and then to have a triumphal entry into Rome. During this time we will be able to search for Lygia freely and hide her safely."
===
The original Polish text says:

— Przyszliście mi na pomoc, gdym już padł. Dzięki wam.

The translation in English would be:

— You came to my aid when I had fallen. Thank you.
===
It was a fact. Sene CA had the strength of soul that Kornutus or Trazeasz did not have, so his life was a series of concessions to crime. He himself knew and understood that, as a follower of Zenon's principles, he should have followed another path, and he suffered from this more than from the fear of death itself.

The light of the fire! — thought Viniciusz.

Here, he strained himself once more: it seemed for a moment that he would wrench his hand from the cross and reach out menacingly over Caesar, but suddenly his frail arms stretched even further, his body sank lower, and his head fell on his breast, and he died.

Here is the translated fragment from "Quo vadis" in English:

The crowd fell silent. Suddenly, Caesar rose, raised his hand to the ceiling, and began reciting:

Translation:

— Petronius?...

She left soon after, full of inner concern and anxiety. Formerly, in prayer, she had offered her heart to Christ, pure and radiant, like a dewdrop. Now, the peace of that flower had been tainted. A poisonous insect had crept in, and its humming was perturbing her. Even sleep, after two nights without rest, had brought her no consolation. She dreamed that, on the Ostrianum, Nero, at the head of an orszak of augustians, bachantek, korybantes, and gladiators, trathed the crowds of Christians with a wreath-crowned chariot, and Vinicius caught her in his arms, pulled her up to his breast, and, embracing her, whispered: „Come with us!“

"But Ursus, who was a naive man and who heard Vinicius talking that the Greek was with him at the Ostrianum cemetery, and then saw that he and Kroton entered the house where Lygia lived, stopped for a moment and said:"
===
— Wait here; maybe someone will come — replied Viniciusz. — We don't need to be seen in the courtyard.
===
The text in question is in Polish and reads:

— Czy to jest owa zakładniczka, w której się kocha Viniciusz?

The English translation of the text is:

— Is this the hostage in which Vinicius is in love?

After saying this, he pulled out a letter from under the purple headboard and began to read what follows:

— But first, before you, he confessed his plan to me — and I, who know you and your love for Christ, explained it to him that it was not you who is the traitor, but the unknown one who wanted to lead him to murder.
===
— Your mortal eyes have seen nothing, because the deity makes itself invisible to whom it pleases. Know that when I was in the temple of Vesta, she stood next to me and said to me in the flesh of my ear: "Postpone your departure." It happened so unexpectedly that I was afraid, though for such a visible protection of the gods over me, I should be grateful.

— Eunice always stays in her cubicle at night, with the elderly Akryzyona and Ifida. After your bath, my lord, she never stays in the bathhouse... Other slaves mock her and call her the Dianna.

A Chilo answered:

So their surprise was great when they saw that the veil separated from the yard not a apartment, but a dark corridor, at the end of which a garden could be seen, consisting of a few cypress trees, a few mirt bushes and a small house, attached to the rear blind wall of another building.
===
— Do you want me to list all those who had some sense and therefore lived up to eighty or ninety years of age during the reigns of Tyberiusz, Caligula, Claudiusz i Neron? Let the example of Domiciusz Afer serve as just one of them: this man grew old peacefully, even though his whole life was spent as a thief and bandit.

The translation of the given fragment from "Quo_vadis" in English is:

The fire of Westa has been defiled, because Rubria was with Caesar. She spoke with you...

— Unfortunately, so are these times — replied Aulus. — I have lost two teeth at the mouth of a stone, which Bryton threw, and by this my speech has become whistling, but the happiest moments of my life I spent in Britain...

And in the meantime, Peter began to speak in a voice at first so quiet that it was hardly audible:
===
And he embraced her, but Akte began to defend her, and shedefended herself with the last effort, because she knew that she was dying. Futile was her attempt with both hands to remove his hairless arm from her; futile was her voice, in which there was sorrow and fear, as she pleaded with him not to be like that, and to have mercy over her. The intoxicated breath of wine was coming closer and closer to her face; now he was no longer the old, good, almost dear friend Vinicius, but a drunk, bad, satyr who filled her with fear and disgust.
===
"Filled with anger and sudden surprise, the gaze of Poppea began to move from Caesar to Vinicius, and finally to Petronius."

While the slaves brought three-legged, decorated with bull heads, bronze misas with coals, and began to sprinkle small amounts of myrrh and nard.

But Urban said:

They passed by the Vatican hills, which were burning red with the fire, but after passing the Vatican field they turned to the right, towards the Tiber, and, after crossing it, they reached Porta Flaminia. At that moment, Chilo stopped the donkey and said:

"I wanted her before, and now I want even more. When I held her hand, a fire blew on me... I must have her. If I were Zeus, I would surround her with a cloud, as he surrounded Jo, or I would pour down rain like he poured down on Danae. I would like to kiss her lips until my teeth hurt! I want to hear her scream in my arms. I would kill Aulus and Pomponia, and then take her and carry her to my house on my arm. I will not sleep tonight. I will order one of my slaves to be exercised, and I will listen to his groans."

Here is the English translation of the given fragment from Henryk Sienkiewicz's "Quo vadis":

"Petroniusz however, was not in the least bit interested in the young man's future, for he had secretly arranged for him to marry his own daughter, Eunice, and was happy that the matter had been brought to a happy end. In the meanwhile, however, he was still enjoying the opening of the Games, and was even more pleased to see that Nero was also enjoying himself. He left his chariot at the Circus and went to the amphitheater where he met Chrizotemis, who was also enjoying the opening of the Games. He invited her to the Palatine to join him and Nero in their revelry. Chrizotemis accepted, and they left together for the Palatine. Petronius had made arrangements for the entertainment of the

— He was carried away by pride. Everyone suspected him, no one knew for sure, but he couldn't stand it anymore and, on all sides, he would whisper in confidence. Did you hear the story of Ruffinus?

The translation of the given fragment from Polish to English is as follows:

— Are there many of them? — inquired Viniciusz.
===
— They're plenty of such ones — said — that could start a domestic war, and you remember we were worried if they wouldn't want to defend themselves. And they're dying like sheep.
===
"Yes!" answered Viniciusz.
===
Vinicius was struck by these words and, returning to himself, began to think that maybe the kindness and mercy of the Christians dowodges their soul's incompetence. It seemed to him that people, who have strength and hardness, would not be able to pardon as well. It came to him that perhaps this is the reason for the aversion his Roman soul feels to this doctrine. "We can live and die!" — Petronius said. And they? They know how to forgive, but they do not understand true love or true hatred.
===
The answer to the task is:

— "Scrape yourself. If you scratch your own pimples, you will destroy what is best in you."
===
And you were less sensitive than a stone:
===
"Lord, why have you send me to this nest of the Beast and establish your throne here?"
===
Thinking about it, Petronius felt incredibly exhausted. Is it worth it to live and do so in uncertainty of tomorrow, just to watch such an order of things? The genius of death is not less beautiful than the genius of sleep, and it also has wings at its shoulders.
===
— About Lyga? — exclaimed with surprise Pomponia.
===
— Sir, I have another idea: maybe the Christians have some kind of mark, like some „tesser“ that no one can be allowed to enter Ostrianum without? I know that in the houses of worship, they do this and that I received from Euricius. Allow me to go and find out exactly and to get these marks if they are necessary.

Here is the English translation of the given fragment from "Quo vadis" by Henryk Sienkiewicz:

"Petroniusz, having once been a great elegant, was still, as on, highly estimental. He was a man of the world, and his house was open to all who were either rich or powerful, or who had the ambition to be such. He was a great patron of the arts, and a great enthusiast of the charms of life. He was a dandy, and he loved to be admired; but he was a dandy who was not egotistical, and he was not cruel. He was a man of the open heart, and when the house of Aulus was destroyed by a fire, he took the trouble to comfort the old man, and to comfort Winicjus, who was his friend. He was a man of the open hand, and he was a man who

— Blessed who, like me, has found love in such a closed shape... Sometimes I seem to think that we are two gods... Look, tell me: has Praksyteles, or Miron, or Skopas, or Lyzyas ever created more beautiful lines? Is there on Paros or in Pentelicone a marble as warm, as rosy, and as love-struck? There are people who kiss the margins of their vases, but I prefer to find pleasure where it really is to be found.

However, it seems that some compassionate feelings were still smoldering in his iron-clad chest, for instead of driving the spear into the shield as a signal of alarm, he took Vinicius to the side and said to him:

There was a moment of silence again, after which Petroniusz spoke:

"Where are you going, Mr. Snow?"

And so, when some were pleading to the gods for mercy, others blasphemed them in the face of this terrible catastrophe. We saw elderly men, turning towards the temple of Jupiter Liberator, who, extending their hands, cried: "You are the savior, save your altar and the city!" However, despair was mostly directed against the old Roman gods, who, in the opinion of the population, were obliged to care more carefully for the city. They proved themselves powerless, so they were mockered. Meanwhile, it happened that when on via Asinaria, a procession of Egyptian priests appeared, carrying the statue of Isis, which had been saved from the temple, located in the area of Porta Caelimontana, the crowd rushed forward, yanked the chariot and pulled it to the Gate of Appia, and, having flung the Egyptian priests who dared resist, placed the statue in

— To honor him with a hundred-word summation — answered Petronius, but don't make him save her a second time... Remember how Eol welcomed Odysseus, when he came to ask for a favorable gust of wind again? Deities don't like to be asked again.
