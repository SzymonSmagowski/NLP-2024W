    "page_content": "A large number of inconsequential CPLEX parameters concerning the branch and cut mechanism were left at their default values, resulting in a discretized parameter configuration space of size 3.27 \u00d710^17, comprising 27 categorical, 2 integer, and 2 continuous parameters to be configured.\n\nTo examine ParamILS's behavior on these more challenging problems, significantly longer cutoff times were set for the CPLEX scenarios compared to the BR O A Dscenarios in the previous section. Specifically, a cutoff time of 300 CPU seconds was used for each run of the target algorithm during training, and two CPU days were allotted for every run of each configurator.\n\nThe configuration objective remained to minimize penalized average runtime with a penalty constant of 10. In Table 9, we compare the performance of CPLEX's default parameter configuration against those found by BasicILS(100) and FocusedILS (both employing aggressive capping and bm=2). Similar to Section 6.1, considerable variance was observed between different runs of the configurators in some configuration scenarios (e.g., CP L E X-CLS, CP L E X-MIK), with the best-performing run yielding a parameter configuration that also excelled on the test set.\n\nWhile BasicILS outperformed FocusedILS in 3 out of 5 scenarios regarding mean test performance across ten runs, FocusedILS achieved superior test results in the remaining two scenarios.",
