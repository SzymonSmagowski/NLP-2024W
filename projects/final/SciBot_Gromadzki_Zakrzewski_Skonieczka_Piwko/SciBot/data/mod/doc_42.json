    "page_content": "Here is the rephrased document:\n\nAn Improved Iterative Optimization Approach for Algorithm Configuration.\n\nFollowing a preliminary study, we refined our initial proposal by adopting a more sophisticated sampling strategy. This entailed generating configuration samples from the parameter space and iteratively refining the sampling distribution using repeated applications of F-Race. The resulting automatic configuration approach, dubbed Iterated F-race (I/F-Race), has been previously described in the literature [10,21]. Although a formal outline of the I/F-Race procedure is provided in those publications, its implementation was not made publicly available until now.\n\nThe irace package builds upon this foundation by implementing a general iterated racing procedure that encompasses I/F-Race as one of its special cases. It also incorporates several innovative extensions introduced by Birattari [19], such as the substitution of the paired t-test for Friedman's test. Additionally, irace boasts novel features, including sampling from a truncated normal distribution, a parallel implementation, and an elitist racing procedure to ensure that top-performing configurations are thoroughly evaluated.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the algorithm configuration problem and surveys existing approaches to automatic algorithm configuration. Section 3 describes the iterated racing procedure implemented in irace, along with several extensions, including elitist irace. In Section 4, we illustrate the steps required to apply irace to two case studies.",
