Extensive research has been conducted on the theory of many-instruments bias in econometrics, as exemplified by Hansen et al. (2008) and Hausman et al. (2010).\n\nWithin generalized method of moments (GMM), inaccuracies in estimating a high-dimensional optimal weighting matrix do not contribute to many-moments bias. Bai & Ng (2010) demonstrated that even with the use of the true optimal weighting matrix, inconsistency arises when dealing with numerous moments. In fact, a sparse weighting matrix, such as an identity matrix, can yield consistent estimation when many moments are present, as shown by Meng et al. (2011).\n\nOne possible solution to the many-instrument issue is to assume that several coefficients in Equation 9 are zero, thereby allowing for the application of regularization methods like LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) in the first-stage regression. Penalization helps prevent overfitting while identifying relevant instruments (nonzero coefficients). Ng & Bai (2009) and Belloni et al. (2012) explored these approaches. Any machine learning method that prevents in-sample overfitting during the first-stage regression can be effective.\n\nAn alternative solution is offered by the principal components method, which may have advantages over regularization techniques (Bai & Ng 2010, Kapetanios & Marcellino 2010). The principal components approach is well-known for its dimension reduction capabilities.",
