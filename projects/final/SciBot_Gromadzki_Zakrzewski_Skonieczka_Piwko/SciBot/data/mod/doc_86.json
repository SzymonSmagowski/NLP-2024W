Our framework has demonstrated superior performance compared to other existing frameworks.\n\nAlthough our research primarily focused on individual-based Successive Approximation Evolutionary Algorithms (SAEAs) for solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems (CEPs), future improvements will enable the portfolio framework to accommodate a broader range of optimization algorithms. Furthermore, selecting appropriate algorithm candidates for the portfolio is crucial as it directly impacts the framework's performance.\n\n**Future Research Directions**\n\nInvestigating effective methods for choosing constituent algorithms in SAEAs is essential for enhancing the performance of the algorithm portfolio framework.\n\n**ACKNOWLEDGMENTS**\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the financial support received from the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFC0804003), the Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams (Grant No. 2017ZT07X386), Shenzhen Peacock Plan (Grant No. KQTD2016112514355531), Science and Technology Innovation Committee Foundation of Shenzhen (Grant Nos.
