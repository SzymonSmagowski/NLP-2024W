The ability to solve these efficiently is crucial, both practically and economically. Scheduling, time-tabling, resource allocation, production planning and optimization, computer-aided design, and software verification are just a few examples of such issues. Many of these problems fall under the NP-hard category, implying they are computationally intractable unless a polynomial-time algorithm exists (unless P=NP). However, through strategically crafted heuristic methods, it is often feasible to tackle practically relevant instances of these seemingly insurmountable problems with surprising effectiveness.\n\nThe observed practical efficacy of these heuristics remains typically inaccessible to analytical techniques for proving theoretical complexity results. Consequently, empirical validation through carefully designed computational experiments becomes necessary. State-of-the-art performance is frequently attained using multiple heuristic mechanisms that interact in intricate, non-intuitive ways. For instance, a DPLL-style complete solver for SAT (a paradigmatic NP-complete problem with significant applications in reliable soft- and hardware design) may employ different heuristics to select variables to be instantiated and manage the search process.\n\n...
