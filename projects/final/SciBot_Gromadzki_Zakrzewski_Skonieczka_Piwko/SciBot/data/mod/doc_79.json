    "page_content": "The Conflict-Directed Clause-Learning Solvers: A Critical Component in SAT Resolution\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the general architecture of Conflict-Directed Clause-Learning (CDCL) solvers, a crucial approach to solving Satisfiability (SAT) problems. The CDCL process begins with an optional preprocessing step (0), which employs variable elimination and clause subsumption checks to reduce the size of the formula and optimize the search efficiency (E\u00e9n & Biere, 2005).\n\nThe subsequent search phase involves iteratively generating tree nodes by assigning truth values to literals (Boolean variables or their negations). This assignment triggers an inference step (1) that deduces and propagates forced unit literal assignments. The resulting partial assignments are recorded in the implication graph, a central data structure storing the current state of the search process along with its implications.\n\nThe branching process is repeated until either a satisfying model is found or a conflict arises. In the former case, the solver declares the formula satisfiable and reports the model. Conversely, when a conflict occurs, the CDCL algorithm initiates the conflict analysis component (step 2), which conducts a bottom-up traversal of the implication graph to identify the resolution of clauses encountered during this examination.\n\nThe process terminates upon generating a conflict clause containing only one literal from the current decision level. This conflict clause serves as a critical component in facilitating further search and is constructed through a combination of the implication graph's traversal and clause resolution (Zhang et al., 2001).",
