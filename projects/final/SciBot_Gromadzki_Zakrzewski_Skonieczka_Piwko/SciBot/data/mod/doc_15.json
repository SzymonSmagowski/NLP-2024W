We examine three key areas: global and local explanation techniques, satisfaction of specific properties, and the potential for extension to satisfy additional properties.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nCounterfactual explanations have become an essential tool for understanding AI model decisions. Recent studies have proposed various methods to provide these explanations, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Fill-in-the-Dropout (FIDO). However, a comprehensive comparison of these techniques is lacking. In this work, we investigate the properties satisfied by GAN-based Counterfactual (CF) explanations, FIDO CF saliency maps, and Algorithmic Recourse methods.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nOur analysis focuses on three primary explanation methods:\n\n1. **GAN-based CF Explanations**: These models generate counterfactuals using a Generative Adversarial Network architecture.\n2. **FIDO CF Saliency Maps**: This approach uses the Fill-in-the-Dropout method to create saliency maps for counterfactual explanations.\n3. **Algorithmic Recourse**: A framework that provides explanations by identifying the most relevant features for model predictions.\n\n**Results:**\n\nOur comparison highlights the strengths and limitations of each explanation method (Table 1). We note that both GAN-based CF explanations and FIDO CF saliency maps satisfy certain properties, such as global and local interpretability. However, Algorithmic Recourse has broader applicability but may not fully satisfy some properties.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis study provides a comprehensive comparison of explanation methods for counterfactuals in AI models. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multiple techniques to ensure accurate and informative explanations. Future research should focus on developing more robust and versatile methods that can address the limitations of current approaches.\n\n**References:**\n\nLiu et al. (2019)\nChang et al.
