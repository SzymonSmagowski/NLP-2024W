    "page_content": "Step 4: When a point p lies on the periphery of a cluster, no instances are density reachable from p, and the subsequent instance in the dataset is processed.\n\nStep 5: This process continues until all instances have been traversed.\n\nStep 6: After processing all instances, clusters are identified. A cluster C with respect to Eps (epsilon) and MinPts (minimum points) is a non-empty subset of D that satisfies two conditions:\na) For any p in C, if q is density reachable from p with respect to Eps and MinPts, then q must also be in C.\nb) For any p, q in C, p and q are density connected with respect to Eps and MinPts.\n\nInstances that do not belong to any cluster are classified as noisy instances.\n\nStep 7: For each incomplete instance, nearest neighbors are selected from the same belonging cluster.\n\nStep 8: The missing attribute of an incomplete instance is filled using the averaged value of its nearest neighbors.\n\n4. Experimental Framework, Results, and Analysis\n\nIn this section, we examine the impact of noise on imputation techniques with varying missing rates to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Additionally, we compare our method with a well-known K-mean imputation technique (KMI) [13].\n\nA. Purwar and S.K.
