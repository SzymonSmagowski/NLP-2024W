High Dimensional CLT for Simple and Sparsely Convex Sets\n\nIn this section, we extend the results of Section 2 by considering larger\nclasses of sets; in particular, we examine classes of simple convex sets,\nand obtain, under certain conditions, bounds that are analogous to those\nin Section 2 (Proposition 3.1). Although an extension to simple convex\nsets is not difficult, in high-dimensional spaces, the class of simple convex\nsets is rather",
