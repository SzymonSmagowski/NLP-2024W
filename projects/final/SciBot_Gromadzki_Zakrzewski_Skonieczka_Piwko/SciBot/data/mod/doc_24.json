Multi-Operator-Based MOEAs\n\nIn recent advancements, Multi-Operator MOEAs have emerged as an innovative approach to dynamically allocate computational resources (population sizes) among diverse operators. This adaptive allocation strategy can be either human-designed [11, 12] or automatically learned through machine learning techniques [13, 14]. Notably, inspired by the ensemble learning method AdaBoost [42], Wang et al. [11] proposed a novel approach to adjust population sizes based on accumulated data from previous generations. The goal is to allocate more computational resources to operators that have demonstrated superior performance in the preceding generation.\n\nFurthermore, Gao et al. [12] took a holistic approach by analyzing features across the entire target space, combining solutions generated by multiple operators to determine local search strategies, global search directions, and final convergence paths. Elsayed et al. [13], meanwhile, developed an integrated solver that incorporates two complementary algorithms: one superior algorithm serves as a teacher to optimize itself by learning from the strategy of the other inferior algorithm.\n\nNote: The changes made include rephrasing sentences for clarity and simplicity, removing some words for concision, and adjusting sentence structure for improved readability.",
