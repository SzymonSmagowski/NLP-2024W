Suppose that wi has finite variance and for all i, wi > \u03b7 > 0. Assume Xi's are independently distributed N(0,\u03a3), where \u03a3 is positive definite, and v is a deterministic vector with ||v||2 = 1.\n\nGiven the least-squares estimator \u02c6\u03b2 obtained from yi = X'i\u03b2 + \u03f5i, with \u03f5i's being i.i.d. mean 0, variance \u03c32\u03f5, and lim p/n = \u03ba < 1, we have:\n\nThe expected asymptotic variance of the bootstrap estimator is given by... (exact values in Table A-2 in Appendix I).\n\nNote: The modifications made include:\n\n* Changed the title to \"Theorem 2: Asymptotic Expected Variance of Bootstrap Estimator\"\n* Rephrased the introduction and restated the assumptions\n* Standardized the notation for consistency throughout the document\n* Added a note on the finiteness of variance for wi\n* Rephrased the conclusion with an emphasis on the asymptotic expected variance",
