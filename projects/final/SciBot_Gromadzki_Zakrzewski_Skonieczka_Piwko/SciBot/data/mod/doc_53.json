Test Instance Generation in Instance Space\nThe presentation and potential for insights relies heavily on the selection of instances used to generate the instance space.\n\nTo address this, we propose a novel method for generating test instances with controllable characteristics and locations within the instance space. The conventional approach using random instance generators falls short in creating diverse characteristics, as evident from the location of randomly generated graphs in class H and I of Fig. 2. Our study on the Travelling Salesman Problem has similarly highlighted the limitations of randomly generated and benchmark instances[24], which are often found at the centre of the instance space (corresponding to average features) and fail to explore the boundaries of the instance space.\n\nBy intentionally designing instances with controllable structure, as exemplified by the locations of instances from Culberston's five instance generators (C1-C5) in Fig. 2 , it is possible to create a more comprehensive distribution within the instance space. This diversity is crucial for uncovering how test instance characteristics influence algorithmic behaviour.\n\nHowever, certain complex instance characteristics (such as algebraic connectivity of a graph) may not be easily modifiable using random generators, making it challenging to predict their impact on algorithm performance.",
