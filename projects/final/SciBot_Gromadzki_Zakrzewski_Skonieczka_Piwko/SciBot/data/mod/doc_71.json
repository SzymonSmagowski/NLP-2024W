The results are presented below:\n\n| Model | BLEU Score (En) | BLEU Score (De) | Perplexity | Training Data |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GNMT + RL Ensemble [38] | 26.30 | 41.16 | 1.8 \u00b7 10^20 | 1.1 \u00b7 10^21 |\n| ConvS2S Ensemble [9] | 26.36 | 41.29 | 7.7 \u00b7 10^19 | 1.2 \u00b7 10^21 |\n| Transformer (base model) | 27.3 | 38.1 | 3.3 \u00b7 10^18 | - |\n| Transformer (big) | 28.4 | 41.8 | 2.3 \u00b7 10^19 | - |\n\n**Implementation Details**\n\nWe applied several techniques to enhance the performance of our models, including:\n\n* **Residual Dropout**: We employed dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, as well as to the sums of embeddings and positional encodings in both encoder and decoder stacks.\n* **Label Smoothing**: During training, we utilized label smoothing of value \u03f5ls = 0.1 [36], which improved accuracy and BLEU score.\n\n**Results**\n\nOur experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble methods for machine translation. The big transformer model achieved a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4 on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, outperforming previously reported models by more than 2.0 BLEU points.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe results presented in this study highlight the potential of ensemble methods for improving machine translation performance. By combining multiple models and techniques, we can achieve state-of-the-art results and advance the field of natural language processing.",
