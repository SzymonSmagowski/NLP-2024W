These explanations are typically presented as concise lists of symptoms with relative weights that either support or contradict a prediction. Humans generally have prior knowledge about the specific domain in question and can use this understanding to accept or reject a model's predictions if they comprehend the reasoning behind them. Notably, providing such explanations has been shown to enhance the acceptance of automated systems, including movie recommendations [12] and other applications [8].\n\nDeveloping trust in machine learning models is also essential. The process typically involves collecting annotated data, from which a held-out subset is used for evaluation. However, relying solely on this validation process may not accurately reflect a model's performance \"in the wild\" due to overestimation of accuracy by practitioners [21]. To address this limitation, examining representative individual predictions can offer an alternative means of assessing a model's truth, especially when these examples are accompanied by explanations.\n\nWe propose augmenting the evaluation process with detailed explanations for several key individual predictions. This approach aims to provide a global understanding of the model's behavior and help identify potential issues such as data leakage \u2013 an unintentional signal leak into training (and validation) data that may not occur in real-world deployment [14].",
