    "page_content": "Although the results presented in Tables VII and VIII provide a summary of PAP's performance across all benchmark functions, they may not fully capture its behavior on individual functions. To gain more insight into PAP's dynamics, this study conducted case studies on three selected functions: f9 (a generalized version of Rastrigin's function), f2 (Schwefel's problem 2.22), and fcec12 (Schwefel's problem 2.13). Two instantiations of PAP were examined in the case studies, each composed of a different combination of constituent algorithms.\n\nInitially, we considered PAP instantiated with only two constituent algorithms: SaNSDE and CMA-ES. This simplified setup allowed for a clearer understanding of how PAP's behavior relates to that of its individual components. Given that SaNSDE and CMA-ES generally outperformed wPSO and G3PCX, the choice of these two was reasonable for our investigation.\n\nIn addition to this configuration, we also explored PAP instantiated with all four constituent algorithms (SaNSDE, CMA-ES, wPSO, and G3PCX). This setup, which had demonstrated superior performance compared to its individual components as well as G-CMA-ES in both Tables VII and VIII, was of particular interest.\n\nFigures 2 through 4 illustrate the evolutionary curves of PAP composed with CMA-ES and SaNSDE on the three selected functions. For each algorithm, we sorted the 30 runs based on the quality of their final solutions and selected the median results for analysis.",
