Furthermore, even when the compared algorithms utilize the same number of function evaluations (FEs), indicated by Ngen and Nsize in NSGA-II/PAP, its performance advantage remains significant. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of the average runtime of our proposed algorithm with the two variants of NSGA-II/MOE for addressing various testing problems. Additionally, we compared the execution time of parallel MOEAs/PAP in both parallel and serial cases, highlighting the speed-up ratios illustrated in Figure 2. Notably, it can be observed that the achieved speed-up ratios by running NSGA-II/PAP in parallel are inferior to the ideal ratios, which are equivalent to the number of member algorithms employed. This disparity is attributed to our current straightforward parallel-running strategy within NSGA-II/PAP, which only executes member algorithms concurrently without parallelizing the Restructure procedure. We acknowledge that incorporating parallelization of the Restructure procedure could further enhance the speed-up ratio and propose this as a valuable research direction for future investigation.\n\nOverall, these results collectively indicate that Population-Based Algorithms (PAPs) are, in general, a potent tool for addressing complex optimization problems.",
