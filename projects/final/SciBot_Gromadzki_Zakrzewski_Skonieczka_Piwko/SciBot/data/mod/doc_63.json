    "page_content": "**Dependence of Imputation Techniques on Data Correlation Structure**\n\nStatistical and machine learning methods for imputing missing data may exhibit inconsistent results due to their inherent dependence on the underlying correlation structure of the dataset [1]. This can be particularly problematic when conducting experiments with randomly assigned missing values, as reported in various studies [2, 3].\n\nTo evaluate the performance of different imputation techniques, researchers have utilized datasets from diverse domains. For instance, a study examining breast cancer patient data found that machine learning methods outperformed statistical approaches in predicting recurrence, significantly improving prognosis accuracy [4]. However, it is essential to note that these results may not generalize across different datasets due to the exclusive use of a single type of data for model development.\n\nRecent investigations have proposed novel techniques for imputing missing values based on feature relevance. One such approach leveraged mutual information to measure feature importance and successfully reduced classification bias [5]. Nevertheless, the random assignment of missing values may have compromised the consistency of these experiments [6].\n\nIn another study, researchers employed Random Forests to handle missing data and specifically investigated the impact of correlation among features on imputation results. The findings indicated that increasing correlation generally improved performance, with the approach being robust across different datasets [7]. Nonetheless, when dealing with Missing Not At Random (MNAR) scenarios, random assignment of missing values may have weakened the experiment's consistency [8].\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Various studies, e.g., [2], [3]\n\n[2] Study on Breast Cancer patient data, [4]\n\n[3] Study on Iris, Wine, Voting, Tic-Tiac-Toe, and Hepatitis datasets, [5]\n\n[4] Machine learning techniques for imputing missing values in breast cancer data, [6]\n\n[5] Novel approach for imputing missing values based on feature relevance, [7]\n\n[6] Experimented on missing data handling using Random Forests, [8]\n\n[7] Liver, Diabetes, Breast Cancer, Heart, WDSC, and Sonar datasets, \n\n[8] Impact of correlation among features on imputation results",
