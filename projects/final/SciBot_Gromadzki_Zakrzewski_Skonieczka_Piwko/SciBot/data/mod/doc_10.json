Pesaran*\n\n*Imperial College Business School, London, UK and Department of Economics, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis paper examines the long-run effects in large heterogeneous panel data models where errors exhibit cross-sectional dependence. We extend existing methods to accommodate for heterogeneity across units while controlling for cross-sectional correlations in the residuals. Our approach uses a two-step procedure, first estimating unit-specific effects and then incorporating these estimates into a common correlated effect model (CCEM). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nIn recent years, there has been growing interest in estimating large heterogeneous panel data models with cross-sectionally correlated errors. However, existing methods often fail to capture both unit-specific effects and cross-sectional correlations simultaneously. This paper aims to bridge this gap by proposing a novel two-step approach that combines the strengths of common correlated effect models (CCEM) and generalized method of moments (GMM).\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nWe begin by estimating unit-specific effects using a GMM-based procedure, which allows for heterogeneity across units. We then incorporate these estimates into a CCEM to account for cross-sectional correlations in the residuals. Our proposed two-step approach is more robust than existing methods and provides consistent estimates of long-run effects.\n\n**Empirical Application:**\n\nWe apply our method to a dataset of macroeconomic variables from 16 OECD countries over the period 1970-2012. Our results show that the proposed two-step approach outperforms existing methods in terms of forecast accuracy and robustness.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis paper contributes to the literature on large heterogeneous panel data models with cross-sectionally correlated errors by proposing a novel two-step approach. Our method combines the strengths of CCEM and GMM, providing more accurate and robust estimates of long-run effects. The empirical application demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in capturing both unit-specific effects and cross-sectional correlations simultaneously.\n\n**References:**\n\n* Connor, G., & Korajczyk, R.
