This choice is motivated by two considerations: (1) avoiding the imputation of missing residual values and (2) preventing noisy test statistics when an asset has limited availability. On average, at any given time t, our analysis uses approximately 58% of all available assets. Consequently, our results should be interpreted as representative only of this subset of assets.\n\nNotably, however, larger and more economically significant assets (e.g., Google and Exxon Mobil) consistently have complete data records and are always included in the test statistic.\n\n**Anomalies to This Approach**\n\nExceptions arise in Figures 8 and 13. These plots span an extended time frame (five years of training data) and utilize adaptive search algorithms over sparse asset subsets. To accommodate this, we relax our usual approach by including all assets in the analysis and imputing missing values as zero. This approach enables the test statistic to adaptively ignore assets with frequent missing data, potentially increasing its power.\n\nHowever, we emphasize that valid p-values can be obtained even if the zero imputation is inaccurate.\n\n**Theoretical Guarantees**\n\nCorollary A.2 demonstrates that, provided no tile contains any missing values, any choice of test statistic will yield reliable results, regardless of the specific implementation chosen.",
