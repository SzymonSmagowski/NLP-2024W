In addition to specifying individual parameter values, understanding their interactions is crucial for algorithm performance. Consider the Con\ufb02ict Factor and Restart Queue parameters, which both in\ufb02uence the restart policy (Huang, 2007), where the search is restarted from the top of the search tree. To encourage Glucose to perform restarts more frequently, both pCF and pRQ should be set to reasonable values (Audemard & Simon, 2012). If not configured properly, these parameters may conflict with each other, resulting in unintended or ineffective restart behavior.\n\nA skilled practitioner could potentially use their domain knowledge to manually configure these parameters, but it is often unclear which settings or parameter interactions will lead to optimal performance. Therefore, instead of relying on domain expertise and manually configuring and testing parameter values, a con\ufb01gurator like ParamILS can be employed. A practitioner collects problem instances, selects an appropriate cost function, and aggregation function to solve the problem.\n\nIn our example, each circuit corresponds to a speci\ufb01c instance for which features fi,d can be computed (Kroer & Malitsky, 2011). It is assumed that this circuit comes from a distribution Pthat specifies all possible circuits for the application and their expected frequencies. The practitioner approximates this distribution using the collected problem instances.",
