This allows us to express the likelihood ratio test statistic LRQ(k) in terms of the restricted and unrestricted covariance matrices.\n\nSpecifically, we have that\n\nLRQ(k) = \u2212klog(|\u02dc\u03a31(k)|) \u2212 (T-k) log( |\u02dc\u03a32(k)| ) + LQ0,\nwhere LQ0 is a constant. By expressing the alternative identification condition as t=1 \u02c6gt \u2261 Ir, we can rewrite this expression in terms of the unrestricted covariance matrix \u02c6\u03a3(k).\n\nUsing this reformulation, we obtain that LRQ(k) is equivalent to the likelihood ratio test statistic LR(k), which is given by\n\nLR(k) = \u2212klog(|\u02c6\u03a31(k)|) \u2212 (T-k) log( |\u02c6\u03a32(k)| ).\n\nThe following lemma establishes two key bounds on the behavior of the estimator \u02c6gt.\n\nLemma 1. Under Assumptions 1-7, we have that:\n\n(i). For all k \u2208 [\u01ebT , (1-\u01eb)T ],\n\nmax\nk\u2264t\u2264[(1\u2212\u01eb)T ]\n\u2225 kt=1(\u02c6gt \u2212 H\u2032gt)\u2225 = Op(\u03b4^(-2/N T ))\n\n(ii). For all k \u2208 [\u01ebT , (1-\u01eb)T ],\n\nmax\nk\u2264t\u2264[(1\u2212\u01eb)T ]\n\u2225 kt=1(\u02c6gt \u02c6g\u2032t - H\u2032gt g\u2032tH)\u2225 = Op(\u03b4^(-2/N T ))\n\nThe proof of these bounds is provided in the online appendix.\n\nProof of Theorem 1:\n\nNote that the identification condition can be expressed as t=1 \u02c6gt \u2261 Ir, where H = (\u039b'^(-1))'. This reformulation allows us to rewrite the likelihood ratio test statistic LRQ(k) in terms of the restricted and unrestricted covariance matrices.",
