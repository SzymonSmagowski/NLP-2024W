Notably, XGBoost can handle missing data directly within its framework.\n\nThe ensemble approach used by XGBoost involves constructing a series of decision trees that refine the predictions made by their predecessors, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy. This iterative process corrects errors made in previous iterations, ultimately leading to improved model performance.\n\nClassical mean imputation is a straightforward technique for handling missing data. When encountering missing values, this method simply replaces them with the average value of available data points for each respective variable. This approach is easy to implement and preserves the sample size by ensuring all cases remain in analysis.\n\nMultiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) [36] offers a more sophisticated solution for handling missing data through regression-based imputation. By iteratively modeling each inadequate variable based on other available data, MICE crafts various imputed datasets that reflect the variability of missing values. This process continues until the divergence among different entries falls below a predetermined threshold.\n\nDIMV (Conditional Distribution-based Imputation of Missing Values with Regularization) [37] is an innovative algorithm designed to handle missing data. DIMV works by determining the conditional distribution of each missing value based on other available variables, while incorporating regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. This approach yields a more precise approximation of the missing values and preserves inter-variable connections within the dataset.",
