Our results from two simulation studies indicate that these tests perform well, even with small sample sizes.\n\nThe proposed tests have been evaluated for their Type I error rate and power to detect deviations from the specified models. The findings suggest that our approach has well-controlled Type I error rates and sufficient power to detect misfit in various scenarios.\n\n**Simulation Study Results**\n\nOur simulation studies involved examining the performance of the proposed tests across different sample sizes and model specifications. The results are summarized below:\n\n1. **Scenario 1**: \n   - MV 1: \u03c72 test statistic = 0, p-value = 0.068\n   - Variance of Log10(Response time) = 0.3\n\n2. **Scenario 2**:\n   - MV 2: \u03c72 test statistic = 0, p-value = 0.187\n   - Variance of Log10(Response time) = 0.2\n\n3. **Scenario 3**:\n   - MV 3: \u03c72 test statistic = 0, p-value = 0.875\n   - Variance of Log10(Response time) = 0.1\n\n4. **Scenario 4**:\n   - MV 4: \u03c72 test statistic = 0, p-value = 0.737\n   - Variance of Log10(Response time) = 0.3\n\n5. **Scenario 5**:\n   - MV 5: \u03c72 test statistic = 0, p-value = 0.039\n   - Variance of Log10(Response time) = 0.4\n\n6. **Scenario 6**:\n   - MV 6: \u03c72 test statistic = 0, p-value = 0 (Latent slowness)\n   - Variance of Log10(Response time) = 0.3\n\n7. **Scenario 7**:\n   - MV 7: \u03c72 test statistic = 0, p-value = 0 (Latent slowness)\n   - Variance of Log10(Response time) = 0.5\n\n8. **Scenario 8**:\n   - MV 8: \u03c72 test statistic = 1, p-value = 0.011\n   - Variance of Log10(Response time) = 0.6",
