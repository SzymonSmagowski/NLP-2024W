[10]. In this method, individuals are assigned a maximum lifetime tied to their fitness and the average or best fitness of the overall population. When an individual reaches its maximum lifetime, it is removed from the population. The ratio of offspring to population size remains constant, thereby maintaining a fixed selective pressure while allowing for dynamic adjustments in population size. This approach introduces two new parameters: minimum and maximum bounds on individual lifetimes.\n\nA selectorecombinatorial GA relies exclusively on selection and recombination mechanisms, representing a genetic algorithm that excludes mutation.",
