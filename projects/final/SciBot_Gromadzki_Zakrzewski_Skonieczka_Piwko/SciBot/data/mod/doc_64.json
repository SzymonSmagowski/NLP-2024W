Since these supplementary moves can be generated by k\u2032-opt moves where k\u2032 < k, our focus shifts towards computing PMT (k), specifically the count of pure k-opt moves where removed and added edges are mutually exclusive.\n\nThe derivation of an explicit formula for PMT(k) can be linked to series A061714 in The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences [33]:\n\nPMT (k) = (\u22121)^k \u2211[i=0 to k-1] [(\u22121)^(k-1+i) * (k choose i + 1) / i!] for k \u2265 2.\n\nNotably, the set of pure moves encompasses both sequential and non-sequential maneuvers. To assess the extent to which the search space has been expanded by incorporating non-sequential moves, we will calculate SPMT(k), the number of sequential, pure k-opt moves, and compare this count with PMT(k). An explicit formula for SPMT(k) can be obtained from a previously established result due to Hanlon, Stanley, and Stembridge [12].",
