Introduction**\n\nThe concept of survival of the fittest has undergone significant refinement in modern evolutionary theory. Our understanding now emphasizes the struggle for survival at the genetic level, rather than individual organisms.\n\n**2. Variable Trees**\n\nA fundamental aspect of sexual reproduction is recombination, facilitated by separate chromosomes that can be combined in unique ways. In our computational model, we introduce a similar concept by allowing users to define the genome structure. This enables the coupling and decoupling of parameters, aligning with the notion that certain groups of variables are more closely linked than others.\n\n**2.1 Variable Tree Design**\n\nOur design takes inspiration from biological systems, where recombination is a natural process. By introducing variable structures, users can specify which parameters should be treated as sets or permuted arbitrarily. This allows for greater flexibility in modeling complex relationships between solver parameters.\n\n**2.2 Recombination and Genetic Diversity**\n\nThe integration of gender and recombination in our model enhances the search space, reducing the number of fitness evaluations required. By introducing variable structures, we encourage exploration of diverse parameter combinations, promoting a more comprehensive understanding of the problem domain.\n\n**Fig. 1. Variable Tree**\n\nThis diagram illustrates the variable tree structure, where nodes represent parameters and edges indicate relationships between them. The user can specify which variables should be coupled or decoupled, reflecting their understanding of the problem's underlying dynamics.\n\n**3. Implications for Evolutionary Optimization**\n\nOur variable tree approach has significant implications for evolutionary optimization algorithms. By leveraging insights from biology, we have created a framework that captures the essence of genetic recombination and diversity. This allows our model to better navigate complex search spaces, ultimately leading to more effective solutions.\n\nNote: The original text was modified to improve clarity, grammar, and readability, while maintaining the core ideas and concepts presented in the paper.",
