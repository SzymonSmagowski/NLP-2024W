Building on this framework, Moon & Weidner (2015) extended their study by allowing an unknown number of factors. They demonstrated that the limiting distribution of the least squares estimator remains unaffected by the number of factors used in estimation, provided it is not fewer than the true number of factors.\n\nSubsequently, Lu & Su (2016) proposed the adaptive group LASSO method, which enables simultaneous selection of relevant regressors and determination of the optimal number of factors. In a distinct setup, Pesaran (2006) considered individual-specific slopes, specified by yit = \u03b1'dt + X'it\u03b2i + uit, where dt represents observed common effects such as seasonal dummies. The model allows unobserved factors and individual-specific errors to follow arbitrary stationary processes.\n\nInstead of estimating factors and factor loadings, Pesaran (2006) devised an auxiliary OLS regression. To control for common factors, the proposed Common Correlated Effects (CCE) estimator can be obtained by augmenting the model with additional regressors: cross-sectional averages of dependent and independent variables. The augmented model is defined as zij = [yit, X'it]' with zij denoting the vector of observed variables.",
