To address this, we developed a new theoretical framework that asymptotically estimates (1) the magnitude of the MLE's bias, (2) its variability, and (3) the distribution of the LRT. Our empirical analysis demonstrates remarkable accuracy of these predictions in finite samples. Moreover, our novel approach relies solely on a single scalar metric: the overall strength of the signal. This insight enables us to formulate concrete procedures for adjusting inference by learning a single parameter from data.\n\n1 Introduction\n1.1 Logistic Regression and Its Limitations\n\nLogistic regression remains the most widely used model for estimating binary response probabilities based on multiple features [40, 41, 55]. Its applications span various fields, including social sciences, finance, and medicine. For instance, logistic regression is often employed to predict coronary heart disease risk from patient characteristics. As a result, every statistics graduate student or researcher working with data is likely familiar with logistic regression.\n\nHowever, this widely used model has severe limitations in practice. In particular, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) exhibits significant bias issues, leading to drastically incorrect predictions for case probabilities based on covariate values. This limitation necessitates a more comprehensive understanding of the MLE's behavior and development of alternative methods that can accurately estimate binary response probabilities.\n\nIn this paper, we address these limitations by developing a new theoretical framework that asymptotically estimates (1) the magnitude of the MLE's bias, (2) its variability, and (3) the distribution of the likelihood ratio test (LRT). We empirically demonstrate the remarkable accuracy of these predictions in finite samples. Our approach relies solely on a single scalar metric: the overall strength of the signal. This key insight enables us to formulate concrete procedures for adjusting inference by learning a single parameter from data.\n\nIn what follows, we provide a brief overview of our results and outline their implications for statistical practice.",
