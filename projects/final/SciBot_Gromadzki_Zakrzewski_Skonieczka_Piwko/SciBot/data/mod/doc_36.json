However, intentionally crafted poisonings deliberately aim to evade detection while undermining model reliability. Various data sanitization techniques have been proposed [39, 72, 114] over the years, but a recent study [87] demonstrated that even these methods are susceptible to evasion attacks. Consequently, we anticipate an ongoing arms race between poisoning strategies and countermeasures.\n\n3.4 **Multimodal Data Integration: A Crucial Consideration**\n\nThe management of data also involves addressing the complexities associated with multimodal data integration [11]. Our preceding discussions implicitly assumed single-source datasets; however, in reality, data scientists frequently encounter diverse data from multiple sources. For instance, autonomous vehicles generate vast amounts of data, including video streams, radar and lidar data, and thousands of irregular time series from the vehicle's Controller Area Network (CAN). To effectively analyze this comprehensive dataset, some form of data integration is necessary. In machine learning, two relevant techniques for multimodal integration are alignment and co-learning. Alignment involves identifying relationships between sub-components with multiple modalities. For example, when dealing with multi-view time series, subsampling, forward, or backward methods can be employed to facilitate meaningful comparison.",
