(1987) **Statistical Analysis with Missing Data**, Wiley, New York.\n\nThis seminal work by Little and Rubin laid the foundation for modern methods in missing data analysis, focusing on statistical estimation techniques to address missing values.\n\nBuilding upon this foundation, subsequent research has led to the development of new algorithms and techniques:\n\nLittle,R. and Schluchter,M. (1985) **Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Mixed Continuous and Categorical Data with Missing Values**, Biometrika, 72, 497\u2013512.\nIn this study, Little and Schluchter proposed a maximum likelihood approach to handle mixed data types with missing values.\n\nMazumder,R. et al. (2010) **Spectral Regularization Algorithms for Learning Large Incomplete Matrices**, J. Mach. Learn. Res., 11, 2287\u20132322.\nThis work by Mazumder and colleagues introduced spectral regularization techniques to handle large-scale incomplete matrices in machine learning applications.\n\nOba,S. et al. (2003) **A Bayesian Missing Value Estimation Method for Gene Expression Profile Data**, Bioinformatics, 19, 2088\u20132096.\nIn this study, Oba and collaborators proposed a Bayesian approach for missing value estimation in gene expression data, which has since been widely adopted.\n\nRaghunathan,T. et al. (2001) **A Multivariate Technique for Multiply Imputing Missing Values using a Sequence of Regression Models**, Surv. Methodol., 27, 85\u201396.\nThis research by Raghunathan and colleagues introduced a multivariate approach to multiply impute missing values in datasets.\n\nRubin,D. (1978) **Multiple Imputations in Sample Surveys-a Phenomenological Bayesian Approach to Nonresponse**, Proceedings of the Survey Research Methods Section, American Statistical Association, pp. 20\u201334.\nIn this influential paper, Rubin proposed a phenomenological Bayesian approach to address non-response in sample surveys.\n\nRubin,D. and Schafer,J. (1990) **Efficiently Creating Multiple Imputations for Incomplete Multivariate Normal Data**, Proceedings of the Statistical Computing Section of the American Statistical Association, pp. 83\u201388.\nThis work by Rubin and Schafer presented an efficient method for creating multiple imputations in incomplete multivariate normal data.\n\nNote: The original document only listed references without additional text, so I added some introductory sentences to provide context.",
