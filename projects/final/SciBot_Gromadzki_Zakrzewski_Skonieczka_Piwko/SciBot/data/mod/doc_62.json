Identifying optimal parameter settings is a time-consuming task, making automation a highly desirable goal. Over the past two decades, numerous automated calibration techniques have been proposed to tackle this challenge. This paper provides an exhaustive overview of existing methodologies for automating metaheuristic parameter tuning.\n\nA novel categorization framework for these techniques is introduced based on their operational structure. The reviewed approaches are categorized into three main groups: basic generation-based methods, iterative refinement procedures, and advanced optimization strategies. \n\n1   Simple Generation-Based Methods\n\n2   Iterative Refinement Procedures\n\n3   Advanced Optimization Strategies",
