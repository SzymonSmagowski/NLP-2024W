Fan et al. (2008) investigated the impact of covariance matrix estimation on optimal portfolio allocation and risk assessment using an observed factor model with large dimensions.\n\nFan et al. (2011) further examined the case with unobserved factors by assuming a sparse error covariance matrix, which allows for cross-sectional correlation in errors as an approximate factor model. An adaptive thresholding technique was employed to address this issue.",
