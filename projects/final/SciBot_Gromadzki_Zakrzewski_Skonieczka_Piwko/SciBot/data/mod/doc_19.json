The one-month Treasury bill rates obtained from the Kenneth French Data Library are used as the risk-free rate for calculating excess returns.\nFurthermore, we compile the 46 firm-specific characteristics listed either on the Kenneth French Data Library or utilized by Freyberger, Neuhierl, and Weber (2020).  All these variables are constructed using accounting data from CRSP/Compustat or past returns from CRSP. We adhere to standard conventions in variable definition, construction, and updating. Yearly updated variables are refreshed at the end of each June, following the Fama-French convention, while monthly changing variables are updated at the end of each month for use in the subsequent month. The full details on constructing these variables can be found in the Internet Appendix. In Table A.II, we categorize the characteristics into six groups: past returns, investment, profitability, intangibles, value, and trading frictions.",
