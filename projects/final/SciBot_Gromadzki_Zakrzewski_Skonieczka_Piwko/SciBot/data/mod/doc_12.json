    "page_content": "Here is the rephrased scientific paper:\n\nThe classifier processes input images and generates predictions (K). To refine these predictions, we adjust the temperature of the probability distributions associated with them. Furthermore, MixMatch leverages both labeled examples and unlabeled data with predicted labels. Specifically, it combines two images by overlaying them and averaging their corresponding labels, following the principles of MixUp data augmentation [181].\n\nNext, we will explore unsupervised learning techniques since our dataset lacks explicit labels. To overcome this limitation, we can design tasks that exploit inherent properties of the data. JigsawNet [108] is an example of such an approach. By dividing images into smaller regions without annotations, we can create a jigsaw puzzle task where the correct order and positions are known (as illustrated in Fig.10). A context-free network (CFN) is trained to solve this puzzle, enabling its subsequent transfer or fine-tuning on the target task with minimal labeled data.\n\n5 Fair Model Training\n\nWe now address the issue of model fairness, which can be triggered by biased training data leading to discriminatory and unfair models. This problem is closely related to robust model training, where we aim to mitigate bias rather than noise in the data. A notorious example is the COMPAS tool [analysis omitted for brevity], used to predict an individual's likelihood of committing another crime.",
